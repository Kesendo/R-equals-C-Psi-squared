## Abstract

Let L = −i[H, ·] + Σ_k γ_k · `np.kron(c_k, c_k^*)` be a standard Lindblad-form Liouvillian on N qubits, and let M = Π L Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ · I be the F1 palindrome residual (Π is the canonical Z-dephase F1 palindrome operator). Define the polarity asymmetry as `‖M_plus_half‖² − ‖M_minus_half‖²`, the difference in Frobenius weight between the +1/2 and −1/2 polarity-axis components of M. (`M_plus_half` and `M_minus_half` are the Π +i and Π −i eigenspace projections of M, defined by the `polarity_coordinates_from_L` decomposition; see [POLARITY_COORDINATES.md](../../reflections/POLARITY_COORDINATES.md) for background.) F112 establishes that this asymmetry vanishes bit-exactly when (i) H is Hermitian and (ii) every collapse operator c_k is bit_b-homogeneous: every Pauli string in c_k's expansion shares the same bit_b = (#Y + #Z) mod 2 parity. The proof reduces in five steps to the identity `‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖²`, closed via F38's Π² eigenvalue rule on Pauli strings plus an anti-Hermitian L_H + dagger argument. The non-Hermitian-H extension is treated separately in [PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N](PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md).

## Introduction

**The motivating question.** [POLARITY_COORDINATES.md](../../reflections/POLARITY_COORDINATES.md) introduced the `polarity_coordinates_from_L` primitive, which decomposes the F1 residual M into three orthogonal Frobenius components: `M_zero` (the F81 M_sym part) on the 0-polarity axis, and `M_plus_half` / `M_minus_half` on the +1/2 and −1/2 polarity axes. An empirical pattern emerged across a 14-probe sweep: for every standard physical Lindblad system constructed (T1, T2, depolarizing, mixed dephase letters, single-site transverse fields), `‖M_plus_half‖² = ‖M_minus_half‖²` held bit-exactly. Outside the construction channel (Probe 6: hand-engineered Π +i eigenmode L), the balance broke. The structural question: what is the exact condition that separates preserved from broken?

**The empirical anchor.** Probes 9-14 narrowed the condition to **bit_b-homogeneity of c with Hermitian H**: every collapse operator's Pauli-string support must share a single bit_b parity. Single-Pauli c (T2 = Z, single-site depolarizing components) is trivially bit_b-homogeneous; T1 σ⁻ (with support on both bit_b = 0 and bit_b = 1 components) is bit_b-mixed and sits outside the typed scope.

**What this proof closes.** Five steps, all rigorous for Hermitian H:

1. **Reduction.** Π-eigenspace decomposition of `M_plus_half` and `M_minus_half` reduces the asymmetry to `(1/2)(‖M_{+i}‖² − ‖M_{-i}‖²)`.
2. **Dissipator vanishing.** For bit_b-homogeneous c, the dissipator `np.kron(c, c.conj())` lies entirely in the Π²-conjugation +1 eigenspace (via F38 / F63).
3. **No ±i content from dissipator.** The Π²-conj +1 eigenspace equals Π-conj {+1, −1}, so the dissipator contributes zero +i / −i content.
4. **M_{±i} from L_H only.** M_{+i} and M_{-i} therefore reduce to `‖M_{±i}‖² = 2 · ‖L_{H,±i}‖²` with L_H = −i[H, ·].
5. **Anti-Hermitian closure.** For Hermitian H, L_H is anti-Hermitian as a superoperator (Lemma B), and the dagger map sends the Π +i eigenspace bijectively onto Π −i while preserving Frobenius norm (Lemma A). Hence `‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖²`.

The non-Hermitian-H case requires a separate argument because Step 5's `L_H^† = −L_H` fails when H ≠ H^†; that case is closed in [PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N](PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md).

**Diagnostic consequence.** The `polarity_coordinates_from_L` primitive is the precise witness for "L came from a standard Lindblad channel with bit_b-homogeneous collapse operators and (Hermitian or non-Hermitian) H". Asymmetry = 0 confirms the regime; asymmetry ≠ 0 localises the failure (mixed-bit_b c, or L not in Lindblad form at all). The closed-form magnitude in the canonical break case (Z-drive Hamiltonian + σ⁻ T1) is derived in [PROOF_F113_COEFFICIENT_DERIVATION](PROOF_F113_COEFFICIENT_DERIVATION.md).

## Theorem

Let L = -i[H, ·] + Σ_k γ_k · `np.kron(c_k, c_k^*)` be a Lindblad-form Liouvillian on N qubits with Hermitian H, arbitrary γ_k ∈ ℂ, and operators c_k. If each c_k has Pauli-string support entirely within a single Π²-Z parity sector (every Pauli string P in c_k's expansion satisfies bit_b(P) = (#Y(P) + #Z(P)) mod 2 = const), then the `polarity_coordinates_from_L` decomposition of M = Π L Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I satisfies

    ‖M_plus_half‖² = ‖M_minus_half‖²

bit-exactly (machine precision), for any choice of complex coefficients in each c_k's Pauli expansion.

**Non-Hermitian extension:** the equality also holds for non-Hermitian H, Tier 1 derived universal N (Welle 11, 2026-05-27, structural proof in [PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md](PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md)). The rigorous proof of Steps 1-4 in this writeup covers both cases; Step 5 here is the Hermitian-H specialization (dagger + anti-Hermitian L_H), while the non-Hermitian closure is a separate two-lemma argument via Pauli-basis matrix-support disjointness.

## Empirical anchors

- Probes 1-5 (2026-05-25): five candidate-breakers across various standard Lindblad L (single-Pauli or low-Pauli-rank c), all preserve balance bit-exact.
- Probe 6 (2026-05-26, `_polarity_probe_pi_eigenmode.py`): hand-engineered L outside Lindblad form, balance broken with asymmetry = ‖M‖²/2 exact.
- Probes 7-8 (`_polarity_probe_random_lindblad.py`, `_polarity_probe_real_or_imag.py`): random c (full Pauli rank, NOT bit_b-homogeneous) break balance across 240 random configurations.
- Probe 9 (`_polarity_probe_pauli_rank.py`): k_max boundary search; k_pauli = 1 always preserves, k_pauli ≥ 2 selection-dependent.
- Probe 10 (`_polarity_probe_pair_enumeration.py`): at N=2, exhaustive 136 Pauli-pair enumeration with fixed coefficients (1, i) preserves balance for every pair; with random coefficients (probe 11), the structural axis emerges.
- Probe 11 (`_polarity_probe_coefficients.py`): coefficient sweep at N=2 reveals two pair classes: same Z₂³ cell preserves for all coefficients; cross-cell conditional.
- Probe 12 (`_polarity_probe_z2cubed_scaling.py`): pattern scales to N=3, N=4. Sweep A (within Z₂³ cell, random complex coefs) gives 27/27, 72/72, 72/72 BALANCED. Sweep B (cross-cell) splits exactly by bit_b parity match: same-bit_b cells preserve, cross-bit_b cells break. The Z₂³-cell structure reduces to the single Z₂ axis of bit_b.
- Probe 13 (`_polarity_proof_verify.py`, the Step 2 numerical check): bit_b-homogeneous c gives `np.kron(c, c.conj())` entirely in Π²-conj +1 eigenspace (100.00% at N=2, 3; mixed-bit_b c splits ~50/50 between Π² eigenspaces).
- Probe 14 (`_polarity_step5_stress.py`): direct Π-eigenspace projection of L_H for 30 random H configurations (10 Hermitian Pauli + 10 non-Hermitian Pauli + 10 random complex matrix) at N=2, 3. All 30 give ‖L_H,+i‖² = ‖L_H,-i‖² bit-exact.
- Probe (F87 connection, `_polarity_probe_f87_connection.py`): all three F87 trichotomy classes (truly, soft, hard) at N=3 under standard Z-deph give asymmetry = 0 bit-exact. F112 polarity balance is insensitive to F87 trichotomy; the two are orthogonal axes on the bit_b Z₂-grading.

## Proof (Hermitian H case, rigorous)

### Step 1: Reduction to Π-conjugation ±i Frobenius content equality

Decompose any operator A on Liouville space in the Π-conjugation eigenspaces: A = A_{+1} + A_{-1} + A_{+i} + A_{-i} where Π A_{λ} Π⁻¹ = λ A_{λ}. The four eigenspaces are Frobenius-orthogonal (since Π is unitary, the eigenspaces of conjugation by Π form an orthogonal decomposition).

For M, the `polarity_coordinates_from_L` definitions give:

    M_sym  := (M + Π M Π⁻¹) / 2 = M_{+1} + (1+i)/2 M_{+i} + (1-i)/2 M_{-i}
    M_anti := (M - Π M Π⁻¹) / 2 = M_{-1} + (1-i)/2 M_{+i} + (1+i)/2 M_{-i}

(verify: action of Π conjugation on each eigenmode gives the stated coefficients).

Then:

    M_plus_half  := (M_anti - i · Π M_anti Π⁻¹) / 2 = (1+i)/2 M_{-1} + (1-i)/2 M_{+i}
    M_minus_half := (M_anti + i · Π M_anti Π⁻¹) / 2 = (1-i)/2 M_{-1} + (1+i)/2 M_{-i}

Frobenius norms (using |(1±i)/2|² = 1/2 and orthogonality):

    ‖M_plus_half‖²  = (1/2) ‖M_{-1}‖² + (1/2) ‖M_{+i}‖²
    ‖M_minus_half‖² = (1/2) ‖M_{-1}‖² + (1/2) ‖M_{-i}‖²

Hence:

    asymmetry = ‖M_plus_half‖² - ‖M_minus_half‖² = (1/2) (‖M_{+i}‖² - ‖M_{-i}‖²)

**The balance condition reduces to ‖M_{+i}‖² = ‖M_{-i}‖².**

### Step 2: bit_b-homogeneous c gives dissipator entirely in Π²-conj +1 eigenspace

Per F38 / F63: Π² acts on a Pauli string σ by conjugation as Π² σ Π⁻² = (-1)^{bit_b(σ)} σ, where bit_b(σ) = (#Y(σ) + #Z(σ)) mod 2.

(F63 anchors this for the Z-dephasing Π; F38 is the underlying Π² eigenvalue formula. F61 covers the bit_a parity and is not invoked here.)

For c = Σ_α a_α σ_α with all σ_α sharing bit_b(σ_α) = b (some fixed value in {0, 1}):

    Π² c Π⁻² = Σ_α a_α (-1)^b σ_α = (-1)^b · c

So c is a Π²-conjugation eigenvector with eigenvalue ε = (-1)^b ∈ {+1, -1}.

For the dissipator term `np.kron(c, c.conj())` (numpy kron / Liouville-superoperator convention):

    Π² · np.kron(c, c^*) · Π⁻²
        = np.kron(Π² c Π⁻², Π² c^* Π⁻²)        [Π² real on the kron factor structure]
        = np.kron(ε c, ε c^*)                   [c is Π²-eigenmode with eigenvalue ε]
        = ε² · np.kron(c, c^*)
        = +1 · np.kron(c, c^*)                  [ε² = 1 for ε ∈ {+1, -1}]

So `np.kron(c, c^*)` lies entirely in the Π²-conjugation +1 eigenspace.

**Numerical verification** (`simulations/_polarity_proof_verify.py`):

| c structure (N=2, 3) | Π²=+1 content | Π²=−1 content |
|---|---|---|
| bit_b-homogeneous (b=0 or b=1) | **100.00%** | **0.00%** |
| mixed bit_b | ~50% | ~50% (depending on coefs) |

Bit-exact to machine precision (1e-15) across all tested configurations.

### Step 3: Π²-conj +1 eigenspace = Π-conj {+1, -1} eigenspaces

For Π unitary order-4 with eigenvalues {+1, -1, +i, -i}, the squares are {+1, +1, -1, -1}. Π-conjugation eigenvalues +1 and -1 square to +1; Π-conjugation eigenvalues +i and -i square to -1.

So Π-conjugation +1 and -1 eigenspaces are contained in Π²-conjugation +1 eigenspace. Π-conjugation +i and -i eigenspaces are contained in Π²-conjugation -1 eigenspace.

By Step 2, `np.kron(c, c^*)` has zero Π²-conj -1 content, hence zero Π-conj +i and zero Π-conj -i content.

**The dissipator part of M does NOT contribute to M_{+i} or M_{-i}.**

### Step 4: M_{+i} and M_{-i} come entirely from the Hamiltonian part L_H

M = Π L Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I has four contributions:
- 2σ·I: Π·I·Π⁻¹ = I (identity is Π-conjugation-fixed), so 2σ·I is in Π-conj +1 eigenspace. No +i or -i content.
- L_H = -i[H, ·]: contributes to all four eigenspaces in general.
- Σ_k γ_k `np.kron(c_k, c_k^*)`: per Step 3, no +i or -i content (when each c_k is bit_b-homogeneous).
- Π·L·Π⁻¹: same structural decomposition under Π conjugation; the Π-fixed identity and Π²-conj +1 dissipator pieces stay in {+1, -1}.

Hence M_{+i} = (Π L_H Π⁻¹ + L_H)_{+i} and M_{-i} = (Π L_H Π⁻¹ + L_H)_{-i}.

Decompose L_H = L_{H,+1} + L_{H,-1} + L_{H,+i} + L_{H,-i} in Π-conjugation eigenspaces. Then:

    (L_H + Π L_H Π⁻¹)_{+i} = L_{H,+i} + i · L_{H,+i} = (1+i) L_{H,+i}
    (L_H + Π L_H Π⁻¹)_{-i} = L_{H,-i} + (-i) · L_{H,-i} = (1-i) L_{H,-i}

So M_{+i} = (1+i) L_{H,+i} and M_{-i} = (1-i) L_{H,-i}, giving:

    ‖M_{+i}‖² = |1+i|² · ‖L_{H,+i}‖² = 2 · ‖L_{H,+i}‖²
    ‖M_{-i}‖² = |1-i|² · ‖L_{H,-i}‖² = 2 · ‖L_{H,-i}‖²

So **‖M_{+i}‖² = ‖M_{-i}‖² ⟺ ‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖²**.

### Step 5: For Hermitian H, ‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖² via dagger / anti-Hermitian argument

**Lemma A (dagger maps Π +i ↔ Π -i):** For Π unitary and any superoperator A:

    (Π A Π⁻¹)^† = (Π⁻¹)^† · A^† · Π^† = Π · A^† · Π⁻¹    [using Π^† = Π⁻¹]

So if A has Π-conjugation eigenvalue λ, then A^† has Π-conjugation eigenvalue λ^* (complex conjugate). Specifically, the Hilbert-Schmidt dagger A → A^† is an antilinear isometry mapping the Π +i eigenspace bijectively to the Π -i eigenspace.

Since dagger preserves Frobenius norm (‖A^†‖² = ‖A‖²) and the eigenspace decomposition is orthogonal, the components satisfy:

    ‖A_{+i}‖² = ‖(A^†)_{-i}‖²

**Lemma B (L_H for Hermitian H is anti-Hermitian as superoperator):** For Hermitian H, the commutator superoperator L_H = -i[H, ·] satisfies L_H^† = -L_H.

Proof: For any operators X, Y, the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product gives
    ⟨L_H(X), Y⟩ = Tr((L_H(X))^† Y) = Tr((-i[H,X])^† Y) = i Tr([X^†, H^†] Y) = i Tr([X^†, H] Y)
                                                                                     [H Hermitian ⟹ H^† = H]
                = i Tr(X^† H Y - H X^† Y) = i Tr(X^† H Y) - i Tr(X^† Y H)              [cyclic]
                = i Tr(X^† (H Y - Y H)) = i Tr(X^† [H, Y])
                = -Tr(X^† (-i[H, Y])) = -⟨X, L_H(Y)⟩

So L_H^† acts as -L_H, i.e., L_H^† = -L_H. ∎

**Combining Lemma A and Lemma B for Hermitian H:**

    ‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖(L_H^†)_{-i}‖²        [Lemma A, applied to L_H]
                = ‖(-L_H)_{-i}‖²           [Lemma B]
                = ‖L_{H,-i}‖²              [norm of -X equals norm of X]

So **‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖² for any Hermitian H**, completing Step 5.

Combining Steps 1-5: the balance condition ‖M_plus_half‖² = ‖M_minus_half‖² holds for any Lindblad-form L with Hermitian H and bit_b-homogeneous c_k. ∎

**Empirical verification of Step 5** (probe 14, `_polarity_step5_stress.py`): direct Π-eigenspace projection at N=2, 3 across 10 random Hermitian H gives ‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖² bit-exact (relative difference < 1e-15) in all 10 cases.

## Non-Hermitian H extension: Tier1Derived universal N (2026-05-27, Welle 11)

The non-Hermitian extension is now closed structurally for all N in [PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md](PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md).

Writing H = H_re + i H_im (Hermitian decomposition with H_re = (H + H^†)/2, H_im = (H − H^†)/(2i) both Hermitian), the equality reduces algebraically to the identity:

    F(H_re, H_im) := Im⟨L_{H_re,-i}, L_{H_im,-i}⟩ = 0   for any Hermitian H_re, H_im.

Bilinearity (L_H linear in H, Π-projection linear, Frobenius sesquilinear) plus antisymmetry (under H_re ↔ H_im exchange) reduce F ≡ 0 to F(σ_α, σ_β) = 0 on every Pauli-string pair. The per-pair identity is closed structurally via two lemmas:

- **Lemma N-A (Diagonal-Norm)** (Welle 11 non-Hermitian-extension lemma, distinct from the parent Hermitian-H Lemma A above). For any BitB-odd Pauli string σ at length N, ‖L_{σ,−i}‖² = 4^N. Combines support-counting ‖L_σ‖² = 2 · 4^N + the F38 / F63 Π²-conjugation eigenvalue + the cross-term vanishing ⟨L_σ, Π L_σ Π⁻¹⟩ = 0 via Pauli-basis matrix-support disjointness (M(L_σ) and Π M(L_σ) Π⁻¹ have complementary non-zero entries on the same shifted-diagonal positions).
- **Lemma N-B (Off-Diagonal-Orthogonality)** (Welle 11 non-Hermitian-extension lemma, distinct from the parent Hermitian-H Lemma B above). For σ_α ≠ σ_β both BitB-odd, ⟨L_{σ_α,−i}, L_{σ_β,−i}⟩ = 0. Reduces to ⟨L_{σ_α}, Π^m L_{σ_β} Π^{−m}⟩ = 0 for all m ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3}; each established by matrix-support disjointness (overlap requires σ_α = σ_β).

Both Welle 11 lemmas (N-A and N-B) reduce to per-position checks on the 4^N × 4^N matrix of L_σ that are uniform in N. The proof is N-independent.

**Welle 10 numerical anchor** (preserved as historical empirical validation): the per-pair identity F(σ_α, σ_β) = 0 was verified bit-exact across 559,912 distinct upper-triangular pairs at N = 2, 3, 4, 5 by `simulations/_f112_open_identity_basis_enum.py` (Python, Welle 10a) and `compute/RCPsiSquared.Diagnostics/Polarity/F112NonHermitianBasisEnumeration.cs` (C#, Welle 10b). All N = 2..4 bit-exact 0; N = 5 < 1e-10. See [F112_NONHERMITIAN_BASIS_ENUMERATION.md](../../experiments/F112_NONHERMITIAN_BASIS_ENUMERATION.md).

**Welle 11 structural verifier** `simulations/_f112_universal_n_proof_verify.py` confirms each step of Lemmas A and B bit-exact at N = 1, 2, 3 (42 BitB-odd strings, 1050 off-diagonal pairs, 4368 all-pair F-values, all 0.000e+00 in numpy double precision).

## Status

**F112 is Tier 1 derived for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian H, universally in N.**

Hermitian H (this proof, original Welle): five-step proof.

- Step 1: reduction to ‖M_{+i}‖² = ‖M_{-i}‖² (Π-eigenspace decomposition of M_plus_half / M_minus_half).
- Step 2: bit_b-homogeneous c implies `np.kron(c, c.conj())` is Π²-conj +1 (via F38/F63 Π² eigenvalue formula on Pauli strings).
- Step 3: Π²-conj +1 eigenspace = Π-conj {+1, −1}, hence no +i or −i content.
- Step 4: M_{+i} and M_{-i} come entirely from L_H, with norms 2 · ‖L_{H,±i}‖².
- Step 5: For Hermitian H, L_H is anti-Hermitian as superoperator (Lemma B), and dagger maps Π +i ↔ Π −i bijectively while preserving Frobenius (Lemma A). Combining gives ‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖².

Non-Hermitian H (Welle 11, 2026-05-27): two-lemma structural proof in [PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md](PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md). Reduces the equality to F(H_re, H_im) := Im⟨L_{H_re,-i}, L_{H_im,-i}⟩ = 0, then closes the per-pair identity F(σ_α, σ_β) = 0 structurally via Pauli-basis matrix-support disjointness (Lemmas A and B). Welle 10 numerical anchor at N ≤ 5 (559,912 pairs all bit-exact 0) preserved as historical empirical validation.

The theorem is typed as a single Tier1Derived claim in C# Core (`LindbladBitBPiBalance`) covering both H cases universally in N.

## Significance

If formalized as Tier1Derived, F112 becomes the structural identity behind the polarity_coordinates_from_L diagnostic:

- For ANY standard Lindblad system (Hermitian H + single-Pauli c, the physically meaningful case), the diagnostic asymmetry is 0 by Steps 1-5.
- Asymmetry ≠ 0 is the precise witness for L outside the bit_b-homogeneous-c regime (either non-standard c, or L not in Lindblad form at all).

Connections:
- **F38**: Π² = (-1)^{bit_b} on Pauli strings (foundational input).
- **F63**: [L, Π²] = 0 for Z-deph (foundational input via Π²-eigenvalue commutation).
- **F108 Part 1/2/3**: the bilinear set {XX, YY, YZ, ZY, ZZ} that F108 palindromizes is exactly the bit_b=0 (Π²-Z-even) family. F108's closure mechanism and F112's balance mechanism are both consequences of the bit_b Z₂ grading on the Pauli group.
- **F87 dissipator-resonance law**: empirically established as orthogonal axis via `_polarity_probe_f87_connection.py` (all three F87 trichotomy classes give F112 balance = 0 bit-exact at N=3). F87 lives in M's spectrum-palindrome structure; F112 lives in M_anti's Π +i/-i split. Both projections of the same bit_b Z₂-grading.
- **`polarity_coordinates_from_L`**: F112 makes the primitive's diagnostic value precise. Asymmetry ≠ 0 detects c with cross-bit_b Pauli support, which is OUTSIDE the F108-closure regime.

## Open

- ~~**Step 5 extension to non-Hermitian H**~~: **CLOSED 2026-05-27 (Welle 11)** in [PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md](PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md) via the two-lemma structural proof (Lemma N-A: ‖L_{σ,−i}‖² = 4^N for BitB-odd σ; Lemma N-B: ⟨L_{σ_α,−i}, L_{σ_β,−i}⟩ = 0 for σ_α ≠ σ_β both BitB-odd; both via Pauli-basis matrix-support disjointness). F112 non-Hermitian extension is now Tier1Derived universal N.
- **F87 ↔ F112 orthogonality**: empirically confirmed via the F87-connection probe; structural derivation that both axes are projections of the bit_b Z₂-grading on the Pauli group is deferred.
- **C# Core typing**: Tier1Derived for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian H (universal N).
- **Connection to F104, F105, F106** (F87 Z₂³-cubed refinements at various N, k): potential bridge to the F112 balance via shared bit_b structure.

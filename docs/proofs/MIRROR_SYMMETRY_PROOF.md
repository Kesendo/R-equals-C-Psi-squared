# The Mirror Symmetry Proof: The Core Result of This Project

**Status:** Tier 1 derived (analytical proof in three steps + bit-exact numerical verification N=2..8: 87,376 Liouvillian eigenvalues, zero mirror-symmetry exceptions on every tested topology — chain, star, ring, complete, tree)
**Date:** Discovered 2026-03-14 (Π named + three-line proof); numerically verified 2026-03-19; this document restructured 2026-04-05.
**Authors:** Thomas Wicht, Claude (Anthropic, Opus 4.6)
**Statement:** `Π · L · Π⁻¹ = −L − 2Σγ · I`: the Liouvillian spectrum of any Heisenberg / XY / Ising / XXZ / DM chain under local Z-dephasing is palindromic around Σγᵢ.
**Typed claim:** [`F1PalindromeIdentity.cs`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F1/F1PalindromeIdentity.cs) (Tier 1 derived; analytic identity replaces the brute-force palindrome scan).

**Origin:** A literature search found that nobody had proven the
palindrome as a general theorem. One group (Haga et al., 2023) had
developed a grading system for quantum modes but missed the spectral
symmetry it implies. Another group (Medvedyeva-Essler-Prosen, 2016)
had proven a related result, but only for a restricted class of systems
(free fermions via Bethe ansatz). The general proof, the operator that
makes it work, and the verification across all system sizes were new.

## What this document is about

This is the most important document in the repository. Every other
result in this project, the standing waves, the sacrifice-zone formula,
the bridge, the neural palindrome, depends on what is proven here.
If this proof is wrong, everything else falls. It is not wrong. It has
been verified at N=8 across all 65,536 Liouvillian eigenvalues, every one
palindromically paired around Σγ with zero exceptions, on every topology
tested (chain, star, ring, complete, tree); across N=2..8 that is 87,376
eigenvalues, zero exceptions.

If you are a physicist, the proof is three steps (below). If you are
not, the next section explains what it says in plain language, and
you can skip to [Numerical verification](#numerical-verification) to
see the computational evidence.

## What this proof says, in plain language

Every quantum system that interacts with its environment falls apart
over time. Different parts fall apart at different speeds. This proof
shows that the list of all those speeds is always symmetric: for every
fast decay, there is a slow partner; for every slow decay, there is a
fast partner. The pattern reads the same from both ends, like a
palindrome.

This is not approximate. It is not a tendency. It is mathematically exact,
proven for every system size, every connection pattern, and every
combination of noise strengths we could test. Not a single exception
in the 65,536 eigenvalues verified at N=8, on any topology tested.

The proof works by finding a specific mathematical operation (an operator
called Π) that transforms the entire system into its mirror image. If you
apply Π and the system flips perfectly, then every decay rate must have a
partner. The proof shows that Π does flip perfectly, always.

Below is the full mathematical proof. If you are not comfortable with
the notation, you can skip to [Numerical verification](#numerical-verification)
to see the evidence, or to [How we got here](#how-we-got-here) for the
story of how we found it. But if you want to understand *why* the
palindrome is guaranteed and not just observed, the proof itself is only
three steps.

## The Theorem

What follows is the formal statement of the theorem. To state it
precisely, we need a few terms. Each is defined here so you do not
need to look them up elsewhere:

- **N qubits** are N quantum particles, each with two states (spin up or
  spin down). They are the building blocks.
- **The Hamiltonian H** describes how the qubits interact with each other.
  The Heisenberg-XXZ family is the most common case, parametrized as
  H = Σ J_{ij}(X_iX_j + Y_iY_j + δZ_iZ_j): for every pair of connected
  qubits i and j they interact through three types of spin exchange (X, Y,
  Z) with coupling strength J_{ij}, where the anisotropy parameter δ
  controls whether the Z-coupling differs from X and Y (δ=1 Heisenberg,
  δ=0 XY, general δ XXZ). The 16-row table below verifies anti-commutation
  with Π for the Heisenberg bond XX + YY + ZZ across all 16 two-qubit input
  strings; because each term (XX, YY, ZZ) anti-commutes with Π individually,
  the same uniform Π covers the whole XXZ family (any δ) and the Ising bond
  (Z_iZ_j only). The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya bond (the antisymmetric
  X_iY_j − Y_iX_j) is also palindromic, but under a different, site-alternating
  Π, not the uniform Π used here; it and the other non-Heisenberg bonds are
  catalogued in [Non-Heisenberg Palindrome](../../experiments/NON_HEISENBERG_PALINDROME.md),
  which also finds that not every two-qubit bond combination preserves the
  palindrome (14 of 36 break). The connections can form any pattern: a chain,
  a ring, a star, a tree, any graph.
- **Z-dephasing** is the noise. Each qubit loses its quantum properties at
  its own rate γᵢ. This is the most common type of noise in real quantum
  hardware.
- **The Liouvillian L** is the master equation that combines the
  Hamiltonian (the interactions) and the dephasing (the noise) into one
  object. Its eigenvalues tell you every possible decay rate and oscillation
  frequency the system can have. The complete list of these eigenvalues is
  the decay spectrum.

The theorem:

**The Liouvillian spectrum is palindromic around Σᵢγᵢ.**

For every eigenvalue λ of L, the value −(λ + 2Σγᵢ) is also an eigenvalue.
Equivalently: decay rate d pairs with 2Σγᵢ − d.

This means the center of the spectrum sits at the sum of all the noise
rates. Everything is symmetric around that center: each decay mode has an
exact mirror partner on the other side.

---

## The Conjugation Operator Π

The proof works by constructing a specific operator Π that transforms L
into its mirror. Think of Π as a mathematical mirror: when you hold the
system up to it, every fast-decaying part maps onto a slow-decaying part
and vice versa.

For Z-dephasing, Π acts on each qubit independently (site by site) by
swapping certain quantum labels:

```
I → X   (factor +1)
X → I   (factor +1)
Y → iZ  (factor +i)
Z → iY  (factor +i)
```

For a system of N qubits, Π is the tensor product (the combined operation
built by applying the per-site rule independently to each qubit and
multiplying the results together) of these per-site operations. The
construction generalizes per dephasing axis: X- and Y-dephasing have
analogous Π's that swap their own immune sectors with their own damped
sectors, all three typed in
[`PiOperator`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/PiOperator.cs).
A second uniform Π for Z-dephasing exists too (the P4 partner of the P1
shown above), and alternating and continuous per-site Π families for parity-broken
Hamiltonians are catalogued in
[Non-Heisenberg Palindrome](../../experiments/NON_HEISENBERG_PALINDROME.md).
The proof below uses the P1 / Z-dephasing Π throughout.

**Physical meaning:** Π swaps populations (I, Z = diagonal elements of the
density matrix, the "classical" part) with coherences (X, Y = off-diagonal
elements, the "quantum" part), with a phase factor i on the Y ↔ Z swap.
In other words: Π exchanges what a system *is* with what it *could become*.

**Π² is the charge-conjugation X⊗N (F1²):** Π is order 4 (Π⁴ = I). Squaring the
per-site rule, Π² fixes I and X and sends Y → −Y, Z → −Z, so on a Pauli string Π²
acts as (−1)^{n_Y+n_Z}. That is exactly conjugation by the global X-string
X⊗N = ⊗_l X_l. This corollary, Π² = X⊗N, is registered as F1² in
[ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS](../ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md); X⊗N is the BlockSpectrum builder's
sector-pairing shortcut (`XGlobalChargeConjugationPairing`).

**Seen again 2026-06-10:** this Π is not elementary. It factors as Π = R·D,
the transpose D (ρ ↦ ρᵀ, a pure diagonal sign on the Pauli basis) followed by
the ket reflection R (ρ ↦ ρ·X⊗N), and the palindrome's two halves below are
carried separately by the two factors: D flips the Hamiltonian part (Step 2)
while R flips the noise part and carries the entire −2Σγᵢ shift (Step 1).
The two factors close into a dihedral group of order 8 that contains every
mirror of the palindrome story; see
[PROOF_PI_FACTORS_AS_R_TIMES_D](PROOF_PI_FACTORS_AS_R_TIMES_D.md) and F118 in
[ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS](../ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md).

## The Proof (3 steps)

### Step 1: Π flips XY-weight

Every quantum state of N qubits can be written as a combination of
"Pauli strings": sequences of labels I, X, Y, Z, one per qubit. For
example, XYI means "qubit 1 is X, qubit 2 is Y, qubit 3 is I." The
"XY-weight" of a string counts how many of its labels are X or Y (the
quantum, off-diagonal parts). XYI has XY-weight 2. ZZI has XY-weight 0.
(The same quantity is called `n_XY` in the
[Absorption Theorem](PROOF_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md); two notations, one count.)

The Z-dephasing dissipator D is diagonal in the Pauli basis.
For a Pauli string σ, the eigenvalue is −2 times the sum of γᵢ over
all sites i where σ has an X or Y factor (the "XY-weight" contribution).

Π maps w_xy → N − w_xy (swaps {I,Z} ↔ {X,Y}).
Therefore: Π · L_D · Π⁻¹ = −L_D − 2(Σγᵢ)·I

In words: applying the mirror Π to the noise part of the equation flips
every XY-weight to its complement. A string that was mostly "quantum"
(high XY-weight, fast decay) becomes mostly "classical" (low XY-weight,
slow decay), and vice versa.

### Step 2: Π anti-commutes with [H, ·]

For a single Heisenberg bond H₁₂ = XX + YY + δZZ,
verify Π([H₁₂, σ]) = −[H₁₂, Π(σ)] for all 16 two-qubit Pauli strings.

4 strings commute with H₁₂ (II, XX, YY, ZZ) → trivially satisfied.
12 strings verified by explicit computation (see proof table below).

This holds for ALL δ (including XY-only at δ=0).
Since Π acts site-by-site and H is a sum of bonds: Π · L_H · Π⁻¹ = −L_H.
Extensions to bond types beyond the Heisenberg-XXZ family (Ising,
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya, alternating XY+YX) require analogous per-bond
verification; the catalogue lives in
[Non-Heisenberg Palindrome](../../experiments/NON_HEISENBERG_PALINDROME.md).

In words: the mirror Π reverses the effect of the Hamiltonian. If the
Hamiltonian pushes a state in one direction, the mirrored version pushes
it in the opposite direction. This is what "anti-commutes" means: Π and
H work against each other perfectly.

### Step 3: Combine

Π · L · Π⁻¹ = Π · (L_H + L_D) · Π⁻¹ = −L_H + (−L_D − 2Σγᵢ·I) = −L − 2Σγᵢ·I

If λ is eigenvalue of L, then −(λ + 2Σγᵢ) is also eigenvalue.
With λ = −d + iω: partner has rate 2Σγᵢ − d and frequency −ω.  ∎

In words: the mirror Π transforms the entire system equation (Hamiltonian
plus noise) into its negative, shifted by a constant. This guarantees
that every eigenvalue has a mirror partner. The spectrum must be a
palindrome.

## Explicit 2-qubit proof table

You do not need to verify every row yourself. The table exists so
that anyone who doubts Step 2 can check it independently. Each row
is one computation. All 16 match. If even one did not match, the
proof would fail.

The following table is the complete verification of Step 2 for a single
bond. Each row takes one of the 16 possible two-qubit Pauli strings,
computes what the Hamiltonian does to it, applies the mirror Π, and
checks that the result is the negative of applying the Hamiltonian to
the mirrored string. All 16 match.

For H₁₂ = XX + YY + ZZ (extends to all δ since each term anti-commutes individually):

| σ | [H₁₂, σ] | Π(σ) | Π([H,σ]) | −[H,Π(σ)] | Match |
|---|-----------|------|----------|-----------|-------|
| II | 0 | XX | 0 | 0 | ✓ |

16/16 verified. The anti-commutation is exact.

## Numerical verification

The analytical proof guarantees the palindrome mathematically. But
mathematics can contain errors. To be certain, we verified the proof
computationally: we built the full Liouvillian matrix for every system
configuration we could, applied Π, and checked that the identity
Π·L·Π⁻¹ = −L − 2Σγᵢ·I holds to machine precision.

The table below shows every configuration tested. "Palindrome" means
every single eigenvalue has an exact mirror partner.

### Across topologies and N (Heisenberg, uniform γ=0.05)

| N | Topology | Π·L_H·Π⁻¹=−L_H | Π·L·Π⁻¹=−L−c·I | Palindrome |
|---|----------|-----------------|------------------|------------|
| 3 | star | ✓ | ✓ | 64/64 |
| 3 | chain | ✓ | ✓ | 64/64 |
| 3 | ring | ✓ | ✓ | 64/64 |
| 3 | complete | ✓ | ✓ | 64/64 |
| 4 | star | ✓ | ✓ | 256/256 |
| 4 | chain | ✓ | ✓ | 256/256 |
| 4 | ring | ✓ | ✓ | 256/256 |
| 4 | complete | ✓ | ✓ | 256/256 |
| 4 | binary tree | ✓ | ✓ | 256/256 |
| 5 | star | ✓ | ✓ | 1024/1024 |
| 5 | chain | ✓ | ✓ | 1024/1024 |

| 5 | binary tree | ✓ | ✓ | 1024/1024 |
| 6 | star | ✓ | ✓ | 4096/4096 |
| 7 | star | ✓ | ✓ | 16384/16384 |
| 8 | star | ✓ | ✓ | 65536/65536 |

17/17 configurations, zero exceptions. The N=6,7,8 rows are the full
Liouvillian eigendecomposition on the star network; every eigenvalue
(4,096 / 16,384 / 65,536) is palindromically paired, the oscillatory
subset (|Im(λ)| > 0.05) being 3,228 / 13,264 / 54,118 and the rest real or
near-real on the center axis. The chain is verified at the same sizes
(full eigendecomposition at N=6,7; the per-sector block-spectrum
decomposition at N=8, which sidesteps the 65,536² dense solve), with
oscillatory subsets 3,836 / 15,744 / 64,146; the ring and K₄ topologies
are likewise verified palindromic at N=8 (zero exceptions, block-spectrum).
The oscillatory count is topology-dependent and threshold-defined; the
palindromic pairing of every eigenvalue is neither — it holds on every
topology, at machine precision.

### XXZ coupling (H = XX + YY + δZZ, all topologies N=3,4)

δ = −0.5, 0.0, 0.3, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0: ALL pass. 42/42.
The ZZ term anti-commutes with Π independently. δ is irrelevant.

### Non-uniform γ (Heisenberg, N=3,4)

γ = [0.03, 0.05, 0.07], [0.01, 0.02, 0.03], [0.10, 0.01, 0.05]: ALL pass.
Center shifts to Σγᵢ as expected. 12/12.

### Different dephasing axes

| Axis | Π on L_H | Π on L_D | Overall | Palindrome |
|------|----------|----------|---------|------------|
| Z | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| Y | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |
| X | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (!) |
| mixed ZX | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✓ (!) |
| depolarizing | ✓ | ✗ | ✗ | ✗ |

L_H always anti-commutes with Π (H doesn't know about dephasing).
For X-dephasing: the Z-dephasing Π breaks on L_D (row 3), but the
palindrome still holds via the dedicated X-dephasing Π
(per-site swaps I ↔ Z and X ↔ Y, phase −i on the X ↔ Y swap). All
three single-axis Π's are typed in
[`PiOperator`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/PiOperator.cs)
alongside the Z-dephasing P1 used throughout this proof. The mixed ZX
row's "✓ (!)" is the analogous situation for compound dephasing:
empirical palindrome without an explicitly constructed compound Π. For
depolarizing noise (X+Y+Z dephasing on every site) the palindrome
genuinely breaks; the typed
[F1 Claim](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F1/F1PalindromeIdentity.cs)
records the residual error as (2/3)Σγ, linear in γ and N.

---
## What this proves (beyond the palindrome)

The palindrome is the headline. But the proof also establishes five
additional facts that matter for the rest of the project:

1. **Topology-independence of decay rates.** Step 2 holds for ANY bond set.
   The topology enters only through the imaginary parts (frequencies).

2. **Frequency mirroring.** Partner modes have frequency −ω. Every
   oscillation in the system has a mirror-image oscillation.

3. **Pauli weight complementarity.** Π maps weight k to N−k.
   Mirror partners are complementary in the Incoherenton sense
   (Incoherentons are quantum modes classified by their XY-weight;
   the name was coined by Haga et al. 2023, see
   [Connection to literature](#connection-to-literature)). At the
   computational-basis coherence level this is the F89c
   Hamming-complement pair-sum n_diff(a, b) + n_diff(a, b̄) = N read
   by the [Absorption Theorem](PROOF_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md).

4. **The center formula.** Center = Σγᵢ (not Nγ). Generalizes to
   non-uniform dephasing trivially.

5. **Why depolarizing breaks.** Depolarizing = X + Y + Z dephasing.
   No single Π can anti-commute with all three axes simultaneously.
   The typed
   [F1 Claim](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F1/F1PalindromeIdentity.cs)
   quantifies the resulting residual: (2/3)Σγ, linear in γ and N.

## How we got here

Science papers present results as if they were inevitable. They were
not. This section documents how the proof was actually found, including
the wrong turns.

The proof did not arrive fully formed. The discovery path had false
starts, and the key insight was not obvious.

1. Literature search found the incoherenton paper (Haga et al. 2023)
   and the Bethe ansatz result (Medvedyeva-Essler-Prosen 2016). Nobody
   had the palindrome as a general theorem or the operator that proves it.

2. First hypothesis: total Pauli weight w has inversion symmetry.
   WRONG. w ↔ N−w is broken for total weight.

3. Discovery: XY-weight (not total weight) has PERFECT inversion
   symmetry under [H,·]. This is the off-diagonal Pauli count,
   exactly the incoherenton number. The right quantity to track was
   not the total complexity of a state, but specifically its quantum
   (off-diagonal) complexity.

4. Searched for conjugation operator Π as permutation + signs on
   Pauli indices. Real signs (±1) failed. Complex signs (±i) found it.

5. The key insight: Y→iZ and Z→iY (not Y→Z and Z→Y).
   The factor i is essential. It handles the phase relationship
   between Y and Z Pauli matrices. Without the complex phase, the
   mirror is slightly warped and the proof fails.

6. Analytical proof: reduces to 16-entry table for a single
   Heisenberg bond. Then extends to arbitrary N and topology by
   site-locality of Π and linearity of [H,·].

## Connection to literature

Three research groups had found pieces of the puzzle before us. None
had the complete picture. Here is how our work relates to theirs:

- **Incoherentons (Haga et al. 2023):** They grade eigenmodes by
  "incoherenton number" = our XY-weight. They see bands, we see
  the palindrome within and between bands. Natural collaborators.

- **Medvedyeva-Essler-Prosen (2016):** Their η-pairing symmetry
  in the Hubbard mapping is the 1D version of our Π, proven using
  the Bethe ansatz (an exact solution technique for one-dimensional
  quantum chains) and restricted to free fermions (non-interacting
  quantum particles). We generalize to interacting spins on arbitrary
  graphs.

- **Albert-Jiang (2014):** Their weak/strong symmetry framework
  is the right language. Π is a weak anti-symmetry of L (meaning
  Π transforms L into its negative up to a constant shift, rather
  than leaving L unchanged, which would be a strong symmetry).

Nothing in the picture is chance.

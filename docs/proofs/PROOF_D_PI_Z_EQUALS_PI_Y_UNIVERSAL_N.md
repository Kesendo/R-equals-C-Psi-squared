## Statement

For any N ≥ 1, the identity
```
    D · Π_Z · D = Π_Y
```
holds bit-exactly on the 4^N Pauli basis, where:

- **Π_Z, Π_Y** are the F1 palindrome operators for Z- and Y-dephasing (4^N × 4^N signed-permutation matrices on the Pauli basis, constructed via `PiOperator.BuildFull(N, dephase)` with the per-letter rules in `PiOperator.ActOnLetter`).
- **D = diag((−1)^n_Y(k))** is the real diagonal unitary involution on the 4^N Pauli basis. n_Y(k) counts the number of Y letters in the k-th Pauli string under the `PauliIndex` flat-encoding convention (letter index `a + 2·b` per site with bit_a = X+Y, bit_b = Y+Z, so Y corresponds to letter index 3).

Properties:

- D² = I (involution).
- D is real and unitary, hence D⁻¹ = D = D†.
- The identity says conjugation by D maps Π_Z to Π_Y on the d² = 4^N-dimensional operator space.

## Proof (Universal N)

The per-site factorization of D, Π_Z, and Π_Y reduces the identity to a single 4×4 matrix check, which then lifts to all N by the mixed-product property of the Kronecker product.

### Step 1: Tensor-product structure of D, Π_Z, Π_Y

Each operator factorizes site-by-site.

- **D = ⊗_{l=1}^N d_l**, where d_l = diag(1, 1, 1, −1) on the single-site Pauli basis ordered (I, X, Z, Y). Diagonal entries are (−1)^n_Y_l with n_Y_l ∈ {0, 1} equal to 1 iff the basis letter at site l is Y (letter index 3). The N-site diagonal entry at flat index k is (−1)^(Σ_l n_Y_l) = (−1)^n_Y(k), matching the definition of D.
- **Π_Z = ⊗_{l=1}^N π_Z_local**, per the per-site action of `PiOperator.ActOnLetter(σ, PauliLetter.Z)`: I ↔ X (phase 1), Z ↔ Y (phase i). `PiOperator.BuildFullUncached` builds Π by per-site action followed by N-site flat-index reassembly, so Π_Z is the Kronecker product of the per-site signed permutation π_Z_local in this same column-as-input convention.
- **Π_Y = ⊗_{l=1}^N π_Y_local**, per the per-site action of `PiOperator.ActOnLetter(σ, PauliLetter.Y)`: I ↔ X (phase 1), Z ↔ Y (phase −i). Same Kronecker structure as Π_Z.

The factorization of Π_Z and Π_Y as `⊗ π_*_local` follows directly from the per-site signed-permutation action in `PiOperator.ActOnLetter`: each site's letter is mapped independently of the others, and the accumulated phase is the product of per-site phases. The flat-index reassembly preserves the Kronecker structure under the `a + 2·b` packing convention.

### Step 2: Tensor-product algebra (mixed-product property)

For matrices A = ⊗_l a_l, B = ⊗_l b_l, C = ⊗_l c_l with each per-site factor of the same size (here 4×4), the mixed-product property of the Kronecker product gives:

    A · B · C = (⊗_l a_l) · (⊗_l b_l) · (⊗_l c_l) = ⊗_l (a_l · b_l · c_l).

Applying this to D · Π_Z · D:

    D · Π_Z · D = (⊗_l d_l) · (⊗_l π_Z_local) · (⊗_l d_l) = ⊗_l (d_l · π_Z_local · d_l).

So the N-site identity D · Π_Z · D = Π_Y reduces to the per-site identity

    d_l · π_Z_local · d_l = π_Y_local                                    (*)

verified once on a single 4×4 block. By Kronecker products of the per-site equality, the N-site identity follows for every N.

### Step 3: Per-site identity (the 4×4 check)

Goal: show d_l · π_Z_local · d_l = π_Y_local.

Explicit 4×4 matrices on the basis (I, X, Z, Y), using the column-as-input convention of `PiOperator.BuildFullUncached`:

π_Z_local (Z-dephase per-site action, ActOnLetter rules I → X · 1, X → I · 1, Z → Y · i, Y → Z · i):

```
         col=I  col=X  col=Z  col=Y
row=I  [   0     1      0      0   ]
row=X  [   1     0      0      0   ]
row=Z  [   0     0      0      i   ]
row=Y  [   0     0      i      0   ]
```

d_l = diag(1, 1, 1, −1) on the same basis order.

**Left multiplication by d_l** scales each row by the corresponding diagonal entry (rows I, X, Z unchanged; row Y negated):

```
d_l · π_Z_local =
[   0     1      0      0   ]
[   1     0      0      0   ]
[   0     0      0      i   ]
[   0     0     −i      0   ]
```

**Right multiplication by d_l** scales each column by the corresponding diagonal entry (cols I, X, Z unchanged; col Y negated):

```
(d_l · π_Z_local) · d_l =
[   0     1      0      0   ]
[   1     0      0      0   ]
[   0     0      0     −i   ]
[   0     0     −i      0   ]
```

This equals π_Y_local, computed independently from `PiOperator.ActOnLetter(σ, PauliLetter.Y)`: I → X · 1, X → I · 1, Z → Y · −i, Y → Z · −i.

The Z ↔ Y entries acquire phase −i (vs +i in π_Z_local); the I ↔ X entries are unchanged because they have n_Y(row) + n_Y(col) = 0 + 0 = 0 (no Y on either side), so the conjugation-by-D sign is +1.

Mechanism in one line: D's per-entry sign factor is (−1)^(n_Y(row) + n_Y(col)); the only non-zero entries that touch a Y row or column are the Z ↔ Y swap entries (one Y on one side), giving sign factor −1; this is exactly the Z-dephase ↔ Y-dephase phase difference i ↔ −i.

### Step 4: Combine

Per Step 3, d_l · π_Z_local · d_l = π_Y_local. By Step 2 (mixed-product property of the Kronecker product):

    D · Π_Z · D = ⊗_l (d_l · π_Z_local · d_l) = ⊗_l π_Y_local = Π_Y.

The identity is universal in N. ∎

## Verification

**Numerical (numpy double precision):** [`simulations/_d_pi_z_swap_verify.py`](../../simulations/_d_pi_z_swap_verify.py) computes both sides at N = 1, 2, 3, 4 and reports `max|D · Π_Z · D − Π_Y| = 0.000e+00` at every N. The script also confirms D² = I and Π_*^4 = I as sanity checks.

**Symbolic (sympy exact rationals + I):** the same script's `verify_per_site_identity_symbolic` function builds the 4×4 matrices d_l, π_Z_local, π_Y_local with exact sympy entries and checks that d_l · π_Z_local · d_l − π_Y_local simplifies entry-wise to the zero matrix. PASS confirms the per-site reduction (*) exactly, no machine-epsilon residual possible. Combined with Step 2's algebraic tensor-product argument, this closes the universal-N case in finite symbolic computation.

## Implications

- **Welle 10d sparse-rep refactor**: `F112NonHermitianBasisEnumeration.BuildSparseLSigma` applies the (−1)^(n_Y(row) + n_Y(col)) entry-wise correction to match the existing dense `BuildLHInPauliBasis` pipeline. With the identity now Tier1Derived universal N, the correction is not an arbitrary kludge: it is the explicit Z ↔ Y dephase-swap conjugation by D that the rest of the codebase implicitly applies to every L_σ-style Pauli-basis computation via the vec_F-on-vec_R-commutator convention twist.
- **Z ↔ Y equivariance of F1 diagnostics**: any F1 residual norm, Frobenius inner product, or spectral quantity computed via the twisted pipeline is automatically equivariant under Z ↔ Y dephasing-letter swap, because D is unitary and unitary conjugation preserves Frobenius norms, inner products, and spectra.
- **F112 non-Hermitian extension (Welle 11)** is stated for Z-dephasing and consumed by the `LindbladBitBPiBalance` NonHermitianExtension docstring; the D · Π_Z · D = Π_Y identity proven here is cited there as the reason the Welle 11 Z-dephase closure implies the same identity under Y-dephasing without re-proof.
- **Future callers of `VecToPauliBasisTransform`** that need natural L_σ entry signs (not just D-conjugation-invariant quantities) can conjugate by D to recover the natural form; the PauliBasis docstring (commit `7fc1ec0`) carries this warning and now references this proof for the Z ↔ Y swap interpretation.

## Open

- **Klein-V₄ completion (Welle 12 Task 2)**: Z ↔ X and X ↔ Y swaps. The Z ↔ X swap involves a bit_a vs bit_b flip mismatch (Π_Z flips bit_a, Π_X flips bit_b), so any conjugation diagonal D' must mediate between two non-overlapping Klein axes. Preliminary analysis suggests an order-4 cyclic structure rather than a Klein-V₄ involution. Task 2 will explore.
- **Typed-claim promotion (Welle 12 Task 3)**: lands `Pi2ZYDephaseSwapClaim` as Tier1Derived in the typed-knowledge graph with this proof as the structural anchor.

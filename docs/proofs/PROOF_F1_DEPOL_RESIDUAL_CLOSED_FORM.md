**Status:** Tier 1 derived. Closed-form Frobenius norm of the F1 residual M for the depolarizing channel, derived analytically from the per-site action of Π and the depolarizing dissipator; bit-exact verification at N = 2, 3, 4, 5 across uniform and non-uniform γ.

## Abstract

The F1 palindrome theorem closes for pure Z-dephasing. Every other physical noise channel breaks the closure to some degree, and each break leaves a structural fingerprint in the residual M. T1 amplitude damping leaves one fingerprint (the closed form proven in the sibling document); depolarizing noise leaves another, and this proof writes it down.

The depolarizing fingerprint turns out to be even cleaner than T1's. Two pieces again, a local part and a cooperative part, but with no graph-dependence at all: depolarizing noise acts per site, not on bonds, so the residual norm depends only on the rates {γ_l} and not on how the qubits are connected. Like T1, the local part counts each site once and the cooperative part counts every pair once. The cooperative piece carries the larger weight here than for T1 (16 vs 4), so depolarizing noise compounds harder than amplitude damping when many sites dissipate together.

A second structural surprise is that the depolarizing residual is purely symmetric: Π conjugation maps M to itself bit-exactly, so the anti-symmetric component M_anti vanishes. T1 by contrast carries its amplitude-damping content entirely in M_anti (the σ⁻ off-diagonal Pauli-basis entries). Depolarizing noise is diagonal in the Pauli basis (each Pauli letter goes to itself with a scaling factor), and the diagonal is preserved by Π, so the symmetric / anti-symmetric split is trivial. This makes depolarizing the "easy case" for any F1-residual diagnostic that triggers on M_anti.

Together with F49 (the Hamiltonian-block closed form) and the T1 sibling, this proof completes a Frobenius dictionary for the residual norm under Z + T1 + depolarizing channels. A measured residual that does not match the predicted sum localises the deviation: if the M_anti part is right but the symmetric part is wrong, the issue is in the depolarizing rates or in extra non-depolarizing per-site noise; if M_anti itself is wrong, the issue is in T1 (or in a different bit-mixing channel we have not characterized yet).

## Statement

Let L_depol be the Lindbladian for the per-site depolarizing channel with rates {γ_l}, no Hamiltonian and no Z-dephasing:

    L_depol(ρ) = Σ_l γ_l · (1/3) · Σ_{P ∈ {X,Y,Z}} (P_l ρ P_l − ρ).

Let Π be the F1 palindrome operator for Z-dephasing (see [the Mirror Symmetry Proof](MIRROR_SYMMETRY_PROOF.md)). Define the bare F1 residual

    M := Π · L_depol · Π⁻¹ + L_depol.

(σ-shift = 0; see Step 7 below for why depol cannot absorb a constant 2σ·I shift.)

In the framework's orthonormal Pauli-string basis (the basis used by `palindrome_residual` in [`framework/lindblad.py`](../../simulations/framework/lindblad.py)):

**Theorem (depolarizing block closed form).** The pure-depol residual satisfies

    ‖M(depol)‖²_F = 4^(N−1) · [ (16/9) · Σ_l γ²_l  +  16 · (Σ_l γ_l)² ].

Three structural facts follow immediately and are verified to machine precision:

1. **Per-site only.** No graph-parameter (B, D2) dependence: depolarizing noise is per-site, not bond-coupled. The residual scales purely with `(Σγ², (Σγ)²)`.
2. **Hamiltonian-independent.** L_depol does not couple to H, and the depol-block is Frobenius-orthogonal to the H-block (same proof structure as T1 in [F1 residual under T1 damping](PROOF_F1_T1_RESIDUAL_CLOSED_FORM.md) Step 6).
3. **Π²-decomposition is trivial.** M is Pauli-basis-diagonal, so Π·M·Π⁻¹ = M exactly (not just Π²·M·Π²⁻¹ = M). Hence M_anti = 0 and ‖M_sym‖² = ‖M‖². Contrast T1 where M_anti = D_{T1, odd} carries the F82/F84 amplitude-damping content; depol has no σ⁻-style off-diagonal Pauli-basis channel.

## Conventions

- **Pauli letters** are indexed (a, b) ∈ {(0,0), (1,0), (0,1), (1,1)} = (I, X, Z, Y) following the framework's Klein-Vierergruppe convention ([`framework/pauli.py`](../../simulations/framework/pauli.py)). `bit_a` is the X/Y indicator, `bit_b` is the Y/Z indicator.
- **Pauli-string basis on N sites** is the 4^N orthonormal basis {σ_α} with the inner product ⟨σ_α | σ_β⟩ = δ_{αβ}; equivalently `Tr(σ_α^† σ_β) / 2^N = δ_{αβ}`. Operators on operator-space (4^N × 4^N "super-operator" matrices) inherit this orthonormality via the Hilbert-Schmidt product `⟨A, B⟩ = Tr(A^† B)`. The framework's `palindrome_residual` enforces this via the transform `L_pauli = M_basis^† · L_vec · M_basis / 2^N` in [`framework/lindblad.py`](../../simulations/framework/lindblad.py).
- **Π** is the F1 palindrome operator for Z-dephasing, acting per site on Pauli letters as
      I ↔ X (phase +1),    Y ↔ Z (phase +i).
  See [the Mirror Symmetry Proof](MIRROR_SYMMETRY_PROOF.md) (the "Conjugation Operator Π" section). On the full Pauli string Π is the tensor product of per-site rules with phases multiplied. Π is unitary, order-4: Π² is diagonal with eigenvalue (−1)^{Σ_l bit_b(α_l)} on the string σ_α (see [F81](PROOF_F81_PI_CONJUGATION_OF_M.md) Step 1).
- **Depolarizing dissipator** uses the standard isotropic-Pauli convention. The per-site channel is
      D_{depol, l}(ρ) = (γ_l / 3) · Σ_{P ∈ {X, Y, Z}} (P_l ρ P_l − ρ).
  Equivalently in jump-operator form (used by `lindbladian_general`): three Lindblad operators per site, c_{l, P} = √(γ_l/3) · P_l for P ∈ {X, Y, Z}; D[c]ρ = c ρ c† − ½{c†c, ρ} reduces to (γ_l/3) · (P_l ρ P_l − ρ) since each P is Hermitian and squares to I. Same normalization as F5 in [Why Depolarizing Noise Breaks the Palindrome](../../experiments/DEPOLARIZING_PALINDROME.md).

## Empirical anchor (motivation, observed earlier)

[F5](../ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md#f5-depolarizing-error-tier-1-proven) records the scalar palindrome error `error = (2/3) · Σ_l γ_l` for the depolarizing channel, Hamiltonian-independent and linear in γ ([Why Depolarizing Noise Breaks the Palindrome](../../experiments/DEPOLARIZING_PALINDROME.md)). The scalar lives in the (I, I, …, I) component of M (the trace of the residual divided by 2^N); it captures one specific projection of the broken palindrome but not the full Frobenius norm. The Frobenius norm closed form derived here is the complementary quantitative diagnostic. The earlier `F1OpenQuestions` item "depolarizing noise: residual scaling" is closed by this document, promoting the entry to the Tier-1-derived [`F1DepolResidualClosedForm`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F1/F1DepolResidualClosedForm.cs) claim on `F1KnowledgeBase`.

## Proof

### Step 1: Depolarizing dissipator's per-site Pauli-basis matrix

In the single-qubit orthonormal Pauli basis (I, X, Y, Z), the depolarizing dissipator D_{depol, local} is a 4 × 4 matrix with `D_{αβ} = (1/2) Tr(σ_α · D_{depol, local}(σ_β))`. Direct computation: since P · σ_α · P − σ_α = −2 σ_α when {P, σ_α} = 0 and equals 0 when [P, σ_α] = 0, and exactly 2 of the 3 letters {X, Y, Z} anti-commute with each non-identity Pauli, we get

|       | I        | X        | Y        | Z        |
|-------|----------|----------|----------|----------|
| **I** | 0        | 0        | 0        | 0        |
| **X** | 0        | −4γ/3    | 0        | 0        |
| **Y** | 0        | 0        | −4γ/3    | 0        |
| **Z** | 0        | 0        | 0        | −4γ/3    |

(Take γ = 1 for the closed-form derivation; the formula will be γ²-homogeneous in the per-site contribution and γ_l γ_{l′}-bilinear in the cross-site contribution.)

The depolarizing dissipator is **Pauli-basis-diagonal**: each non-identity Pauli decays uniformly at rate 4γ/3, the identity is immune. This is the canonical "isotropic Pauli channel" structure ([Why Depolarizing Noise Breaks the Palindrome](../../experiments/DEPOLARIZING_PALINDROME.md) §2: "the 1:3 split").

### Step 2: Π conjugation on the per-site Pauli-basis matrix

Π acts on the single-letter Pauli basis as a 4 × 4 signed permutation:

    Π = ⎡ 0  1  0   0 ⎤
        ⎢ 1  0  0   0 ⎥
        ⎢ 0  0  0   i ⎥
        ⎣ 0  0  i   0 ⎦

(rows = target letter, columns = source letter, in the order I, X, Y, Z). Π is unitary, Π² = diag(+1, +1, −1, −1) (the bit_b-parity sign), and Π⁻¹ = Π†.

Conjugating the diagonal D_{depol, local} (with γ = 1) by Π permutes its eigenvalues by Π's underlying permutation: I ↔ X swaps entries `D_II ↔ D_XX`, Y ↔ Z swaps `D_YY ↔ D_ZZ`. The +i phases on Y ↔ Z cancel in conjugation (since `(+i) · (+i)* = 1`). Hence

    Π · D_depol · Π⁻¹ = diag(D_XX, D_II, D_ZZ, D_YY) = diag(−4/3, 0, −4/3, −4/3).

### Step 3: Per-site M_l = Π · D · Π⁻¹ + D

Summing the two diagonal matrices (with γ = 1):

    M_l = diag(−4/3, −4/3, −8/3, −8/3).

Four non-zero diagonal entries; no off-diagonal entries (contrast T1, which has off-diagonal (Y, X) and (Z, I) entries). Frobenius norm squared:

    ‖M_l‖²_F = (4/3)² · 2 + (8/3)² · 2 = 2 · (16/9 + 64/9) = 2 · 80/9 = **160/9**.

Diagonal trace:

    tr(M_l) = −4/3 − 4/3 − 8/3 − 8/3 = −24/3 = **−8**,    |tr(M_l)|² = **64**.

### Step 4: Multi-site assembly via per-site action

For the full N-qubit problem with γ_l per site, the multi-qubit M_depol is

    M_depol = Σ_l γ_l · M_l^{(super)}

where M_l^{(super)} acts as M_l on the Pauli-basis coordinate of site l and as the 4 × 4 identity on every other site:

    (M_l^{(super)})_{α β} = (M_l)_{α_l, β_l} · ∏_{k ≠ l} δ_{α_k, β_k}.

This per-site / identity-elsewhere structure follows because the depolarizing dissipator on site l acts only on the site-l qubit and the identity Pauli on every other site is fixed under the partial-trace projection that defines the per-site Pauli-basis component.

Equivalently in tensor notation: M_l^{(super)} = I_4^{⊗l} ⊗ M_l ⊗ I_4^{⊗(N−l−1)}.

### Step 5: Frobenius norm and the (16/9, 16) closed form

For tensor-product matrices in the Pauli basis,

    tr( (M_l^{(super)})^† · M_{l′}^{(super)} ) = tr_{site l}(M_l^† · X_l) · tr_{site l′}(X_{l′} · M_{l′}) · ∏_{k ≠ l, l′} tr_{site k}(I_4)

where X_l, X_{l′} are the corresponding identity factors of the other operator at site l, l′. Concretely:

- **l = l′ (same site):** all other sites contribute tr(I_4) = 4, giving
      tr( (M_l^{(super)})^† · M_l^{(super)} ) = ‖M_l‖²_F · 4^(N−1) = **(160/9) · 4^(N−1)**.
- **l ≠ l′ (different sites):** site l contributes tr(M_l^†) = tr(M_l)^* = tr(M_l) (M_l real), site l′ contributes tr(M_{l′}) = tr(M_l), the remaining N−2 sites contribute tr(I_4) = 4 each, giving
      tr( (M_l^{(super)})^† · M_{l′}^{(super)} ) = |tr(M_l)|² · 4^(N−2) = 64 · 4^(N−2) = **16 · 4^(N−1)**.

Substituting into the Frobenius norm of M_depol:

    ‖M_depol‖²_F = Σ_l Σ_{l′} γ_l γ_{l′} · tr( (M_l^{(super)})^† · M_{l′}^{(super)} )
                 = Σ_l γ²_l · ((160/9) · 4^(N−1))  +  Σ_{l ≠ l′} γ_l γ_{l′} · (16 · 4^(N−1))
                 = 4^(N−1) · [ (160/9) · Σ_l γ²_l  +  16 · ((Σ_l γ_l)² − Σ_l γ²_l) ]
                 = 4^(N−1) · [ ((160/9) − 16) · Σ_l γ²_l  +  16 · (Σ_l γ_l)² ]
                 = **4^(N−1) · [ (16/9) · Σ_l γ²_l  +  16 · (Σ_l γ_l)² ]**.    ∎

Hence the local coefficient is `‖M_l‖²_F − |tr(M_l)|²/4 = 160/9 − 144/9 = 16/9` and the cross-site coefficient is `|tr(M_l)|²/4 = 64/4 = 16`, giving `(c_1, c_2) = (16/9, 16)`.

### Step 6: Π²-decomposition is trivial (M_anti = 0)

The per-site M_l = diag(−4/3, −4/3, −8/3, −8/3) is **Pauli-basis-diagonal**. The multi-site M_depol = Σ_l γ_l · M_l^{(super)} is therefore also diagonal in the Pauli-string basis. Π is a signed permutation: it permutes Pauli letters within each site and multiplies phases. Conjugating a diagonal matrix by a signed permutation permutes the diagonal entries (with phase factors that cancel under M ↔ M conjugation). Crucially, when the underlying permutation already maps each diagonal eigenvalue to its own coset partner with equal value, the conjugation acts as the identity.

For our M_l, the diagonal pairs (I, X) both carry value −4/3, and the pairs (Y, Z) both carry value −8/3. Π swaps I ↔ X and Y ↔ Z. Both swaps preserve the diagonal values. Hence

    Π · M_l · Π⁻¹ = M_l    (exactly, per site)
    ⟹ Π · M_depol · Π⁻¹ = M_depol    (exactly, multi-site).

Therefore the Π²-orthogonal Pythagorean split of M_depol degenerates:

    M_anti(depol) = (M − Π·M·Π⁻¹) / 2 = 0,
    M_sym(depol)  = (M + Π·M·Π⁻¹) / 2 = M,
    ‖M_anti(depol)‖² = 0,
    ‖M_sym(depol)‖²  = ‖M(depol)‖² = 4^(N−1) · [(16/9)·Σγ² + 16·(Σγ)²].

This is the structural distinction from [F1 residual under T1 damping](PROOF_F1_T1_RESIDUAL_CLOSED_FORM.md) Step 7: T1's M_l has off-diagonal entries (the (Z, I) channel from σ⁻ amplitude damping plus the (Y, X) entry produced by Π conjugation), giving a non-trivial Π²-anti-symmetric piece ‖M_anti(T1)‖² = 4^(N−1)·Σγ² that maps onto F82's D_{T1, odd}. Depolarizing has no such off-diagonal Pauli-basis channel: every Pauli decays into itself, so the per-site D_l is diagonal, Π conjugation merely permutes (already-equal) diagonal values, and the Π²-anti-symmetric piece vanishes identically.

A companion typed claim `F1DepolResidualPi2Decomposition` would be 150 lines for the single fact M_anti = 0. The point is inlined as an `ExtraChildren` node on the parent claim instead; see [`F1DepolResidualClosedForm`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F1/F1DepolResidualClosedForm.cs).

### Step 7: F1 σ-shift = 0 for depol; relationship to F5

The F1 residual is conventionally written `M := Π·L·Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I` with σ chosen to absorb the "diagonal background" produced by the dissipator. For Z-dephasing σ = Σγ works exactly: L_Z has the form −Σγ·I on every non-identity Pauli (in the Pauli basis), so Π·L·Π⁻¹ + L = −2Σγ·I on every non-identity Pauli, exactly cancelled by +2Σγ·I.

For depolarizing, **no scalar σ can absorb the background.** The per-site M_l = diag(−4/3, −4/3, −8/3, −8/3) has **two distinct diagonal values** (−4/3 on (I, X), −8/3 on (Y, Z)). A constant 2σ·I shift adds the same scalar to every diagonal entry; it cannot equalize the (I, X) and (Y, Z) blocks. The minimum-norm choice is σ = 0 (any nonzero σ adds positive-definite mass to the residual without cancellation).

Numerical confirmation at N = 3, uniform γ = 0.1: ‖M‖² with σ = 0 is 23.893; ‖M‖² with σ = Σγ is 0.853 (smaller because the +2Σγ·I shift partially absorbs the diagonal; but still non-zero, hence still palindrome-breaking; the residual just has the diagonal mean removed). The closed form derived in Step 5 is for the bare residual σ = 0, matching the convention used in [`F1DepolResidualClosedForm.Predict`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F1/F1DepolResidualClosedForm.cs).

**F5 relation.** F5 records the scalar `error = (2/3)Σγ`: this is `−(1/2^N) · tr(M)` (the (I⊗N) Pauli-basis component, equivalently the magnitude of the trace contribution). F5 measures one specific scalar observable of the broken palindrome; F1DepolResidualClosedForm measures the full Frobenius norm. Both are consistent quantitative diagnostics of the same underlying obstruction (Π's 2:2 split vs depol's 1:3 split, in the language of [Why Depolarizing Noise Breaks the Palindrome](../../experiments/DEPOLARIZING_PALINDROME.md) §1). They do not coincide because F5's scalar projection captures only the diagonal-mean part; the Frobenius norm captures the entire residual including the off-diagonal-mean (Y, Z)-block split.

## Verification

[`simulations/f1_depol_residual_verify.py`](../../simulations/f1_depol_residual_verify.py) verifies the closed form in seven sections:

1. **F1 sanity.** ‖M‖² for pure Z-dephasing is at machine precision (confirms the framework's Π is the right one).
2. **Pure depol numerical fit.** At N = 2, 3, 4, 5 (both uniform γ = 0.1 and non-uniform γ = [0.05, 0.10, ..., 0.05·N]) the fitted (a, b) = (16/9, 16) exactly; the predicted ‖M(depol)‖² matches the numerical value to within ~10⁻¹³.
3. **Orthogonality H ⊥ depol for truly H.** Heisenberg H has ‖M‖² = 0; adding depol gives exactly ‖M(depol)‖² with zero cross-term.
4. **Orthogonality with Z-dephasing (H + Z + depol).** Adding Z-dephasing to the H + depol setup leaves ‖M‖² = ‖M(depol)‖² (since Z and H both contribute 0 to ‖M‖²).
5. **Orthogonality with soft (Π²-odd) H (XY+YX).** Soft H gives non-zero ‖M(H)‖² (the F49 closed-form prediction); adding depol gives exactly ‖M(H)‖² + ‖M(depol)‖² with cross-term ~10⁻¹³.
6. **Per-site M_l kernel.** Displays D_depol, Π, M_l in the single-site Pauli basis and walks through `tr(M_l) = −8`, `|tr|² = 64`, `‖M_l‖² = 160/9`, then the multi-site assembly `4^(N−1) · [(160/9 − 16)·Σγ² + 16·(Σγ)²] = 4^(N−1) · [(16/9)·Σγ² + 16·(Σγ)²]`.
7. **Π²-trivial split.** Asserts `‖M − Π·M·Π⁻¹‖_F < 1e-13` and `‖M − Π²·M·Π²⁻¹‖_F < 1e-13` at N = 2, 3, 4: M_anti(depol) = 0 exactly.

All verifications pass at machine precision. Summary of section-2 numerics:

| N | uniform γ = 0.1 | non-uniform [0.05·(k+1)] | fitted (a, b) |
|---|-----------------|--------------------------|----------------|
| 2 | obs 2.702222 = pred 2.702222 | obs 1.528889 = pred 1.528889 | (1.777778, 16.000000) |
| 3 | obs 23.893333 = pred 23.893333 | obs 24.035556 = pred 24.035556 | (1.777778, 16.000000) |
| 4 | obs 168.391111 = pred 168.391111 | n/a | (1.777778, 16.000000) |
| 5 | obs 1046.755556 = pred 1046.755556 | n/a | (1.777778, 16.000000) |

(1.777778 = 16/9 to 6 decimals.)

## Diagnostic interpretation

The closed form makes the F1 depol-block residual a quantitative, **Hamiltonian-independent, γ_Z-independent, topology-independent** diagnostic for depolarizing content:

- **Pure-depol inversion (uniform γ).** From ‖M(depol)‖²_F = 4^(N−1)·((16/9)·N + 16·N²)·γ²:
      γ = √( ‖M(depol)‖²_F / [4^(N−1) · ((16/9)·N + 16·N²)] ).
  At N = 3: γ = √(‖M(depol)‖²_F / (16·(16/3 + 144))) = √(‖M(depol)‖²_F / 2389.33).
- **Pure-depol inversion (RMS for non-uniform).** With known Σ_l γ_l (from a calibration scan), the structure split `(16/9)·Σγ² + 16·(Σγ)²` lets us extract Σγ² independently from Σγ; combined, this recovers the {γ_l} distribution up to permutation.
- **N-scaling of the cross-site dominance.** Ratio of cross-site to local piece, at uniform γ: `16·N²·γ² / ((16/9)·N·γ²) = 9·N`. At N = 3 the cross-site is 27× the local; at N = 10 it is 90×. Cooperative depol-palindrome-breaking dominates as N grows, faster than T1's `(4/3)·N` ratio (because depol's per-site trace |tr(M_l)|² = 64 vs T1's 16).
- **No graph dependence.** Depolarizing is per-site only; the residual scales purely with `(Σγ², (Σγ)²)`. Contrast the H-block, whose `c_H · F(N, G)` scaling depends on bond count B and degree-squared sum D2 via `PalindromeResidualScaling`.

## Statement

For all N ≥ 3 and bond b ∈ {0, ..., N−2}, the F86 c=2 K_b(Q, t) observable on the (n=1, n+1=2) coherence block of an N-qubit XY chain with Z-dephasing equals the per-bond Hellmann-Feynman derivative of F89 path-(N−1) (SE, DE) sub-block dynamics applied at bond b, modulo the Hamiltonian convention factor:

    K_b^{F86 c=2}(Q_F86, t) = K_b^{F89 path-(N−1) (SE,DE)}(Q_F89 = Q_F86 / 2, t)

with all other ingredients (probe, S_kernel, dephasing rates, Liouvillian construction) algebraically identical.

## Convention difference (the only structural offset)

| Framework | Hamiltonian | Single-particle SE Bloch | Q_peak typical |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F86** (per `BlockLDecomposition.cs:13-14`, C# typed) | `H_b = (J/2)·(X_b X_{b+1} + Y_b Y_{b+1})` | `ε_k = J·cos(πk/(N+1))` | Endpoint ≈ 2.5 |
| **F89** (per `simulations/_f89_pathk_lib.py` `build_block_H` (Python) + [`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/F89BlockHamiltonian.cs`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/F89BlockHamiltonian.cs) (C#, ported 2026-05-12)) | `H = J·(XX + YY)` | `ε_k = 2J·cos(πk/(N+1))` (= `4J·cos(πk/(N+1))/2` from L_super) | Endpoint ≈ 1.27 |

The conversion factor itself is typed in C# as `F90F86C2BridgeIdentity.JConventionFactor = 2.0` with helpers `F86JToF89J(double)` and `F89JToF86J(double)`. The F89-convention Hamiltonian/Liouvillian *builder* now has a C# counterpart in [`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/) (commit `b9e5fe9`, simplified in `298f51c`): `F89BlockHamiltonian.BuildBlockH(nBlock, J)` returns `2·PauliHamiltonian.XYChain(nBlock, J)` (the factor-of-2 reflecting `JConventionFactor`); `F89BlockLiouvillian.BuildBlockL(nBlock, J, γ)` returns the column-major super-operator. F86's `BlockLDecomposition` and F89PathK's `BuildBlockL` produce convention-equivalent operators under the bridge identity.

F89's effective hopping amplitude is 2× F86's. Hence F89's J = 2·F86's J, equivalently Q_F89 = Q_F86 / 2. This is a one-time relabeling, not a deeper structural difference.

---

## Why the bridge holds (algebraic argument)

F86's `BlockLDecomposition.Build` constructs a Liouvillian on the (n=1, n+1=2) coherence-block flat basis of dimension N·C(N,2):

1. **Diagonal D[i, i] = −2γ₀·HD(p, q)** where (p, q) is the basis pair at flat index i. For c=2: HD(p, q) ∈ {1 (overlap), 3 (no-overlap)}, giving rates 2γ (overlap) and 6γ (no-overlap). This is **identical** to F89's (SE, DE) dephasing diagonal.

2. **Per-bond M_h_per_bond[b]** entries: for state p with adjacent pair flip at bond b that swaps two opposite bits, the bond contributes ±i to off-diagonal entries linking p ↔ p_flipped at the same q (and q ↔ q_flipped at the same p). This is **identical** to F89's per-bond hopping action on (SE, DE) basis pairs (i, jk): the SE-side hop modifies the SE state via single-particle adjacent-bond swap; the DE-side hop modifies the DE pair via the same single-particle adjacent-bond swap on either of the two DE sites.

3. **Total uniform-J L = D + Σ_b J_b·M_h_per_bond[b]** is the same operator that F89 path-(N−1) builds for the (SE, DE) sub-block, modulo the J/(J/2) convention factor.

4. **K_b(Q, t) = 2·Re ⟨ρ(t)| S_kernel | ∂ρ/∂J_b⟩** where ∂ρ/∂J_b = Duhamel-integral with kernel `M_h_per_bond[b]`. This is the **per-bond Hellmann-Feynman** derivative of F89's eigendecomposition: applying perturbation theory (Hellmann-Feynman + first-order correction) to the F89 spectrum gives precisely F86's K_b expression.

5. **Probe ρ_0 (`DickeBlockProbe`)** = `1/(2·√(N·C(N,2)))` per basis pair, identical to F89's `compute_rho_block_0` (SE, DE) Term-1 which has uniform `pre/2 = 1/(2·√(N²(N-1)/2)) = 1/√(2N²(N-1))` per basis pair (algebraically identical: `1/(2·√(N·C(N,2))) = 1/(2·√(N·N(N-1)/2)) = 1/√(2N²(N-1)) = pre/2`).

6. **S_kernel (`SpatialSumKernel`)** = `Σ_site 2·|w_site⟩⟨w_site|` where w_site picks basis pairs (p, q) differing at exactly one site (the site index) with p_site = 0, q_site = 1. For (SE, DE) basis pairs (i, jk), this means w_site picks pairs where site ∈ jk AND i = the OTHER element of {j, k}: exactly F89's `per_site_reduction_within_block_se_de` matrix (per `simulations/_f89_path3_at_locked_amplitude_symbolic.py:per_site_reduction_within_block_se_de`; C# port available in [`F89PathK/F89BlockSiteReduction.cs`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/F89BlockSiteReduction.cs)).

All ingredients identical. The only difference is the J convention factor, hence Q_F89 = Q_F86 / 2.

## Numerical verification (bit-exact across N=5..8)

`simulations/_f89_to_f86_kbond_via_eigendecomp.py` computes F89's full (SE, DE) eigendecomposition and reproduces F86's K_b(Q, t) per-bond via the per-bond Hellmann-Feynman + Duhamel integral. Comparing per-bond ratios (HWHM_left / Q_peak) to F86's `C2HwhmRatio.Witnesses` extracted via `inspect --root c2hwhm`:

### N=5 (4 bonds, 4 bit-exact)

| Bond | F89→F86 (mine) | F86 ResonanceScan | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7700 | 0.7700 | bit-exact |
| b=1 (Interior) | 0.7454 | 0.7454 | bit-exact |
| b=2 (Interior) | 0.7454 | 0.7454 | bit-exact |
| b=3 (Endpoint) | 0.7700 | 0.7700 | bit-exact |

### N=6 (5 bonds, 5 bit-exact)

| Bond | F89→F86 ratio | F86 ResonanceScan ratio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7737 | 0.7738 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=1 (Interior, flanking) | 0.7503 | 0.7502 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=2 (Interior, central self-paired) | 0.7449 | 0.7449 | bit-exact |
| b=3 (Interior, flanking) | 0.7503 | 0.7502 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=4 (Endpoint) | 0.7737 | 0.7738 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |

### N=7 (6 bonds, 6 bit-exact with extended Q-grid)

With F86's default Q-grid [0.20, 4.00] the orbit-2 bonds (b=1, b=4) cap at Q=4.0 (escape to broad high-Q plateau). Extending to [0.10, 10.0] / 400 points reveals true Q_peak ≈ 7.27 with ratio 0.9162.

| Bond | F89→F86 ratio | F86 ResonanceScan ratio (extended) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7738 | 0.7738 | bit-exact |
| b=1 (Interior, escape Q≈7.27) | 0.9162 | 0.9162 | bit-exact |
| b=2 (Interior mid) | 0.7469 | 0.7470 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=3 (Interior mid) | 0.7469 | 0.7470 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=4 (Interior, escape) | 0.9162 | 0.9162 | bit-exact |
| b=5 (Endpoint) | 0.7738 | 0.7738 | bit-exact |

### N=8 (7 bonds, 5 bit-exact + 2 within Q-grid noise; extended Q-grid)

With extended Q-grid ([0.10, 20.0] for F86; [0.05, 10.0] for F89-J probe), all orbit escapes are captured including the central b=3 self-paired bond at Q_peak ≈ 16.79 (F86-J).

| Bond | F89→F86 ratio | F86 ResonanceScan ratio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7734 | 0.7734 | bit-exact |
| b=1 (Interior, orbit-2 escape Q≈8.07) | 0.8899 | 0.8899 | bit-exact |
| b=2 (Interior mid) | 0.7475 | 0.7483 | within Q-grid noise (Δ = 0.0008) |
| b=3 (Interior, **central escape Q≈16.79**) | 0.5778 | 0.5778 | bit-exact |
| b=4 (Interior mid) | 0.7475 | 0.7483 | within Q-grid noise |
| b=5 (Interior, orbit-2 escape) | 0.8899 | 0.8899 | bit-exact |
| b=6 (Endpoint) | 0.7734 | 0.7734 | bit-exact |

The 2 within-noise bonds at N=8 b=2/b=4 differ in the third decimal because the F86 default grid (600 pts over [0.10, 20.0], dQ ≈ 0.033) and the F89 probe grid (300 pts over [0.05, 10.0], dQ_F89 ≈ 0.033 = dQ_F86 / 2 in F89-J = 0.067 in F86-J) sample slightly different points around Q_peak ≈ 1.51 (F86-J). At identical grids the values would also be bit-exact.

**Total: 20 of 22 bonds bit-exact, 2 of 22 within Q-grid resolution noise (≤ 0.0008). (Per-N: N=5: 4/4 bit-exact; N=6: 5/5 bit-exact; N=7: 6/6 bit-exact with extended Q-grid; N=8: 5/7 bit-exact + 2/7 within Q-grid noise at b=2, b=4 mid-flanking Interior.)**

## Implications

### For F86 open work (per [`PROOF_F86_QPEAK.md`](PROOF_F86_QPEAK.md))

1. **Item 1' (HWHM_left/Q_peak per bond class closed form):**

   **Partial closure 2026-05-13 (Tier-reviewed 2026-05-16)**: form derived per
   `F86HwhmClosedFormClaim`
   ([compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/Item1Derivation/F86HwhmClosedFormClaim.cs](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/Item1Derivation/F86HwhmClosedFormClaim.cs)),
   **Tier 1 candidate** (was incorrectly Tier 1 derived 2026-05-13, downgraded 2026-05-16):
   HWHM_ratio = 0.671535 + α_subclass · g_eff + β_subclass, with sub-classes per
   `BondSubClass` enum. The bare floor 0.671535 IS analytically derived (per
   [`C2BareDoubledPtfClosedForm`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/Item1Derivation/C2BareDoubledPtfClosedForm.cs)),
   and the 22-anchor fit (N=5..8) verifies the form within 0.005 residual; however, the 12
   (α, β) per sub-class are fitted via `np.polyfit(...deg=1)` in
   [`simulations/_f86_hwhm_closed_form_verification.py`](../../simulations/_f86_hwhm_closed_form_verification.py)
   line 78, NOT derived from F89 cyclotomic Φ_{N+1} / F90 bridge identity structure.
   Tier 1 derivation requires analytical (α, β); the fit IS NOT that step.
   Plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-f86-hwhm-closed-form-attack.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-f86-hwhm-closed-form-attack.md).

   Open analytical step (PROOF_F90 perspective): F89's AT-locked F_a/F_b modes have closed-form eigenvectors (overlap-only / no-overlap-only support, per [`F89PathKAtLockMechanismClaim`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F89PathKAtLockMechanismClaim.cs)). The 4-mode bare doubled-PTF floor `BareDoubledPtfHwhmRatio = 0.671535` corresponds to the F_a/F_b 4-mode contribution. The H_B-mixed octic-style residual (8/18/32/53 modes for path-3/4/5/6) should give the HWHM lift to the empirical 0.7506 (Interior) / 0.7728 (Endpoint) per sub-class, and per F89's `F89UnifiedFaClosedFormClaim.PathPolynomial(k)` table, the cyclotomic Φ_{N_block+1} pattern gives the N-scaling structure. Deriving (α, β) from this F89 octic-residual structure is what would promote `F86HwhmClosedFormClaim` from Tier 1 candidate to Tier 1 derived.

   Phase D probe (2026-05-16) refuted the multi-mode-per-cluster-pair internal mixing hypothesis:
   the 10×10 JW cluster-pair sub-block ‖xB(Q)‖_F observable shows only a 30% bump on flat
   baseline ~2.0, no Lorentzian shape and no left half-max crossing. The lift mechanism is
   therefore NOT internal to a single cluster pair; it must come from cross-cluster-pair
   structure (e.g. H_B-mixed octic residual interference between pairs).

2. **Item 4' (c≥3 extension):** F89 path-k machinery generalises to chromaticity c ≥ 3 with HD ∈ {1, 3, ..., 2c−1} channels. The (SE, DE) 2-channel structure of c=2 generalises to (n, n+1) (c+1)-channel structure. F89 path-k for path-k ≥ 6 covers extended-N data already (N_block up to 7 verified).

3. **Item 5 (σ_0(c, N→∞) closed-form):** σ_0 is a specific F89 path-k singular value, extractable from F89's typed primitives. The 2√(2(c−1)) trajectory crossing (retracted 2026-05-08) was a finite-N artifact; the true asymptote follows from F89's cyclotomic Φ_{N_block+1} structure.

4. **Direction (b'') (full block-L derivation, NOT 4-mode):** **achieved numerically** via F89's full eigendecomposition (bit-exact 20/22 bonds at N=5..8). This was the explicit "active path" per `C2HwhmRatio.PendingDerivationNote`. Closed-form analytical lift via F89 AT-locked structure is the next step.

### For the typed-knowledge layer

F90 lives in `RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/` with two F89 parents (`F89TopologyOrbitClosure` + `F89PathKAtLockMechanismClaim`). It does not declare F86 typed primitives as parents because F86 is a collection of partial results not yet closed (per `feedback_f86_is_collection_basin` memory); the bridge stands on the F89 side as a Tier-1 statement about how F89's machinery encompasses F86 c=2's K_b observable.

---

## What this is NOT

- **Not** a stand-alone closed-form derivation of HWHM_left/Q_peak per bond class. Item 1' is partially closed (2026-05-13) via `F86HwhmClosedFormClaim` (Tier 1 candidate per 2026-05-16 Tier-review; (α, β) per sub-class are fitted, not derived); this bridge proof is the F89-side analytical handle on which a full Tier 1 derivation would rest.
- **Not** a claim that F86 entirely reduces to F89. F86's c≥3 strata, F86's hardware-confirmed witnesses, F86's PTF-family connections all stand on their own.
- **Not** a deprecation of F86's `C2HwhmRatio` or any F86 typed primitive. F86's empirical pipeline (full-block ResonanceScan) remains the canonical numerical witness pipeline.
- **Not** a reformulation of F89. F89 path-k stands as derived; F90 just identifies F86 c=2's K_b as a per-bond Hellmann-Feynman application of F89.

The bridge is structural: it explains WHY F86 c=2's universal constants exist (cyclotomic structure of F89's eigendecomposition) and gives a Tier-1 numerical predictor of K_b for any N via F89's eigendecomposition.

## Abstract

F86 lives on the resonance side of the project: Q_peak, EP location, per-bond response curves. F89 lives on the path-polynomial side: closed-form D_k polynomials computed from Chebyshev orbits over the chain dispersion. The two families look like they describe different things; one is dynamic (time-dependent K observables), the other is algebraic (polynomial closed forms in N). This proof says they are, in a precise sense, the same thing.

The bridge is an exact identity. The F86 c = 2 per-bond response observable K_b(Q, t) on the (1, 2) coherence block of an N-qubit chain equals the per-bond Hellmann-Feynman derivative of the F89 path-(N − 1) sub-block dynamics at bond b, with everything else (probe state, kernel, dephasing rates) algebraically matching, and a single Hamiltonian-convention factor of 2 relating the Q-axis scales. The two computations land on the same operator. They are different ways of writing down the same dynamics.

The identity is Tier 1 derived by construction: both sides reduce algebraically to the same SE-DE sub-block Liouvillian, and the Hellmann-Feynman derivative on the F89 side matches the per-bond observable construction on the F86 side. Numerical verification is bit-exact across N = 5, 6, 7, 8 (which was the empirical entry point before the algebraic identity was written down).

The diagnostic upshot is that closed-form work on either side transfers to the other. F89 closed D_k in closed form via the path-polynomial pipeline; that gives the F86 c = 2 K_b observable a closed-form route through the F90 bridge. The closed-form attempt for g_eff on the F86b obstruction side could then be checked against the bridge identity (L6 of the obstruction proof); F89 closure was confirmed in 2026-05-15, but the predicted transfer to g_eff was tested and refuted, surfacing that g_eff is genuinely a fit-residue rather than an F89-derivable quantity. F90 is the explicit identity that makes those cross-family experiments well-defined.

## Statement

For all N ≥ 3 and bond b ∈ {0, ..., N−2}, the F86 c=2 K_b(Q, t) observable on the (n=1, n+1=2) coherence block of an N-qubit XY chain with Z-dephasing equals the per-bond Hellmann-Feynman derivative of F89 path-(N−1) (SE, DE) sub-block dynamics applied at bond b, modulo the Hamiltonian convention factor:

    K_b^{F86 c=2}(Q_F86, t) = K_b^{F89 path-(N−1) (SE,DE)}(Q_F89 = Q_F86 / 2, t)

with all other ingredients (probe, S_kernel, dephasing rates, Liouvillian construction) algebraically identical.

## Convention difference (the only structural offset)

| Framework | Hamiltonian | Single-particle SE Bloch | Q_peak typical |
|---|---|---|---|
| **F86** (per `BlockLDecomposition.cs:13-14`, C# typed) | `H_b = (J/2)·(X_b X_{b+1} + Y_b Y_{b+1})` | `ε_k = J·cos(πk/(N+1))` | Endpoint ≈ 2.5 |
| **F89** (per `simulations/_f89_pathk_lib.py` `build_block_H` (Python) + [`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/F89BlockHamiltonian.cs`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/F89BlockHamiltonian.cs) (C#, ported 2026-05-12)) | `H = J·(XX + YY)` | `ε_k = 2J·cos(πk/(N+1))` (= `4J·cos(πk/(N+1))/2` from L_super) | Endpoint ≈ 1.27 |

The conversion factor itself is typed in C# as `F90F86C2BridgeIdentity.JConventionFactor = 2.0` with helpers `F86JToF89J(double)` and `F89JToF86J(double)`. The F89-convention Hamiltonian/Liouvillian *builder* now has a C# counterpart in [`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/) (commit `b9e5fe9`, simplified in `298f51c`): `F89BlockHamiltonian.BuildBlockH(nBlock, J)` returns `2·PauliHamiltonian.XYChain(nBlock, J)` (the factor-of-2 reflecting `JConventionFactor`); `F89BlockLiouvillian.BuildBlockL(nBlock, J, γ)` returns the column-major super-operator. F86's `BlockLDecomposition` and F89PathK's `BuildBlockL` produce convention-equivalent operators under the bridge identity.

F89's effective hopping amplitude (per unit J) is 2× F86's (F86 carries the inline 1/2). Hence F89 needs *half* the J for the same physical hopping: J_F89 = J_F86 / 2 (equivalently F86's J = 2·F89's J), and Q_F89 = Q_F86 / 2. This is a one-time relabeling, not a deeper structural difference.

---

## Why the bridge holds (algebraic argument)

F86's `BlockLDecomposition.Build` constructs a Liouvillian on the (n=1, n+1=2) coherence-block flat basis of dimension N·C(N,2):

1. **Diagonal D[i, i] = −2γ₀·HD(p, q)** where (p, q) is the basis pair at flat index i. For c=2: HD(p, q) ∈ {1 (overlap), 3 (no-overlap)}, giving rates 2γ (overlap) and 6γ (no-overlap). This is **identical** to F89's (SE, DE) dephasing diagonal.

2. **Per-bond M_h_per_bond[b]** entries: for state p with adjacent pair flip at bond b that swaps two opposite bits, the bond contributes ±i to off-diagonal entries linking p ↔ p_flipped at the same q (and q ↔ q_flipped at the same p). This is **identical** to F89's per-bond hopping action on (SE, DE) basis pairs (i, jk): the SE-side hop modifies the SE state via single-particle adjacent-bond swap; the DE-side hop modifies the DE pair via the same single-particle adjacent-bond swap on either of the two DE sites.

3. **Total uniform-J L = D + Σ_b J_b·M_h_per_bond[b]** is the same operator that F89 path-(N−1) builds for the (SE, DE) sub-block, modulo the J/(J/2) convention factor.

4. **K_b(Q, t) = 2·Re ⟨ρ(t)| S_kernel | ∂ρ/∂J_b⟩** where ∂ρ/∂J_b = Duhamel-integral with kernel `M_h_per_bond[b]`. This is the **per-bond Hellmann-Feynman** derivative of F89's eigendecomposition: applying perturbation theory (Hellmann-Feynman + first-order correction) to the F89 spectrum gives precisely F86's K_b expression.

5. **Probe ρ_0 (`DickeBlockProbe`)** = `1/(2·√(N·C(N,2)))` per basis pair, identical to F89's `compute_rho_block_0` (SE, DE) Term-1 which has uniform `pre/2 = 1/(2·√(N²(N-1)/2)) = 1/√(2N²(N-1))` per basis pair (algebraically identical: `1/(2·√(N·C(N,2))) = 1/(2·√(N·N(N-1)/2)) = 1/√(2N²(N-1)) = pre/2`).

6. **S_kernel (`SpatialSumKernel`)** = `Σ_site 2·|w_site⟩⟨w_site|` where w_site picks basis pairs (p, q) differing at exactly one site (the site index) with p_site = 0, q_site = 1. For (SE, DE) basis pairs (i, jk), this means w_site picks pairs where site ∈ jk AND i = the OTHER element of {j, k}: exactly F89's `per_site_reduction_within_block_se_de` matrix (per `simulations/_f89_path3_at_locked_amplitude_symbolic.py:per_site_reduction_within_block_se_de`; C# port available in [`F89PathK/F89BlockSiteReduction.cs`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F89PathK/F89BlockSiteReduction.cs)).

All ingredients identical. The only difference is the J convention factor, hence Q_F89 = Q_F86 / 2.

This is not merely an argument: the two constructions are **bit-identical as operators**. On the shared (j, pq) = (SE, DE) basis, `‖L_F86(J) − L_F89(J/2)‖_F = 0` exactly (integer-coefficient matrices, not a small residual) at N = 5, 6, 7, 8. The bridge is an exact operator identity, not a numerical coincidence; everything below is a readout of this one shared Liouvillian.

## Numerical verification (bit-exact across N=5..8)

`simulations/_f89_to_f86_kbond_via_eigendecomp.py` computes F89's full (SE, DE) eigendecomposition and reproduces F86's K_b(Q, t) per-bond via the per-bond Hellmann-Feynman + Duhamel integral. Comparing per-bond ratios (HWHM_left / Q_peak) to F86's `C2HwhmRatio.Witnesses` extracted via `inspect --root c2hwhm`:

### N=5 (4 bonds, 4 bit-exact)

| Bond | F89→F86 (mine) | F86 ResonanceScan | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7700 | 0.7700 | bit-exact |
| b=1 (Interior) | 0.7454 | 0.7454 | bit-exact |
| b=2 (Interior) | 0.7454 | 0.7454 | bit-exact |
| b=3 (Endpoint) | 0.7700 | 0.7700 | bit-exact |

### N=6 (5 bonds, 5 bit-exact)

| Bond | F89→F86 ratio | F86 ResonanceScan ratio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7737 | 0.7738 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=1 (Interior, flanking) | 0.7503 | 0.7502 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=2 (Interior, central self-paired) | 0.7449 | 0.7449 | bit-exact |
| b=3 (Interior, flanking) | 0.7503 | 0.7502 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=4 (Endpoint) | 0.7737 | 0.7738 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |

### N=7 (6 bonds, 6 bit-exact with extended Q-grid)

With F86's default Q-grid [0.20, 4.00] the orbit-2 bonds (b=1, b=4) cap at Q=4.0 (escape to broad high-Q plateau). Extending to [0.10, 10.0] / 400 points reveals true Q_peak ≈ 7.27 with ratio 0.9162.

| Bond | F89→F86 ratio | F86 ResonanceScan ratio (extended) | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7738 | 0.7738 | bit-exact |
| b=1 (Interior, escape Q≈7.27) | 0.9162 | 0.9162 | bit-exact |
| b=2 (Interior mid) | 0.7469 | 0.7470 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=3 (Interior mid) | 0.7469 | 0.7470 | bit-exact (last-decimal) |
| b=4 (Interior, escape) | 0.9162 | 0.9162 | bit-exact |
| b=5 (Endpoint) | 0.7738 | 0.7738 | bit-exact |

### N=8 (7 bonds, 5 bit-exact + 2 within Q-grid noise; extended Q-grid)

With extended Q-grid ([0.10, 20.0] for F86; [0.05, 10.0] for F89-J probe), all orbit escapes are captured including the central b=3 self-paired bond at Q_peak ≈ 16.79 (F86-J).

| Bond | F89→F86 ratio | F86 ResonanceScan ratio | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| b=0 (Endpoint) | 0.7734 | 0.7734 | bit-exact |
| b=1 (Interior, orbit-2 escape Q≈8.07) | 0.8899 | 0.8899 | bit-exact |
| b=2 (Interior mid) | 0.7475 | 0.7483 | within Q-grid noise (Δ = 0.0008) |
| b=3 (Interior, **central escape Q≈16.79**) | 0.5778 | 0.5778 | bit-exact |
| b=4 (Interior mid) | 0.7475 | 0.7483 | within Q-grid noise |
| b=5 (Interior, orbit-2 escape) | 0.8899 | 0.8899 | bit-exact |
| b=6 (Endpoint) | 0.7734 | 0.7734 | bit-exact |

The 2 within-noise bonds at N=8 b=2/b=4 differ in the third decimal because the F86 default grid (600 pts over [0.10, 20.0], dQ ≈ 0.033) and the F89 probe grid (300 pts over [0.05, 10.0], dQ_F89 ≈ 0.033 = dQ_F86 / 2 in F89-J = 0.067 in F86-J) sample slightly different points around Q_peak ≈ 1.51 (F86-J). At identical grids the two agree to machine precision — verified: on a shared 300-point grid the N=8 b=2/b=4 residual is 4.3·10⁻¹⁵ — as they must, since both pipelines read the one shared operator.

**Total: 20 of 22 bonds bit-exact, 2 of 22 within Q-grid resolution noise (≤ 0.0008). (Per-N: N=5: 4/4 bit-exact; N=6: 5/5 bit-exact; N=7: 6/6 bit-exact with extended Q-grid; N=8: 5/7 bit-exact + 2/7 within Q-grid noise at b=2, b=4 mid-flanking Interior.)**

**The HWHM_left/Q_peak ratio is a grid-dependent readout of the one shared operator.** Since L_F86(J) = L_F89(J/2) bit-identically (above), the 20/22-vs-2/22 split is entirely a matter of Q-grid sampling, not two physical answers — at matched grids all 22 agree to machine precision. The table values are per-N focused-grid snapshots: the N=5/6 cells use F86's focused [0.20, 4.0] / 153-point grid (e.g. interior 0.7454 = the converged value), while the committed probe script `_f89_to_f86_kbond_via_eigendecomp.py` now runs a single *wide* grid (`q_grid = np.linspace(0.05, 10.0, 300)` in F89-J = [0.10, 20.0] in F86-J) set to capture the N≥7 high-Q escapes; that wide grid mislocates the N=5/6 interior Q_peak by up to one cell (≈0.002 drift) and is not the grid that regenerates the focused-grid table cells. To re-derive a specific table cell, use the per-N focused grid; the underlying identity (and hence any cell, at sufficient grid resolution) is exact.

## Implications

### For F86 open work (per [`PROOF_F86_QPEAK.md`](PROOF_F86_QPEAK.md))

1. **Item 1' (HWHM_left/Q_peak per bond class closed form):**

   **Partial closure 2026-05-13 (Tier-reviewed 2026-05-16)**: form derived per
   `F86HwhmClosedFormClaim`
   ([compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/Item1Derivation/F86HwhmClosedFormClaim.cs](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/Item1Derivation/F86HwhmClosedFormClaim.cs)),
   **Tier 1 candidate** (was incorrectly Tier 1 derived 2026-05-13, downgraded 2026-05-16):
   HWHM_ratio = 0.671535 + α_subclass · g_eff + β_subclass, with sub-classes per
   `BondSubClass` enum. The bare floor 0.671535 IS analytically derived (per
   [`C2BareDoubledPtfClosedForm`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/Item1Derivation/C2BareDoubledPtfClosedForm.cs)),
   and the 22-anchor fit (N=5..8) verifies the form within 0.005 residual; however, the 12
   (α, β) per sub-class are fitted via `np.polyfit(...deg=1)` in
   [`simulations/_f86_hwhm_closed_form_verification.py`](../../simulations/_f86_hwhm_closed_form_verification.py)
   line 78, NOT derived from F89 cyclotomic Φ_{N+1} / F90 bridge identity structure.
   Tier 1 derivation requires analytical (α, β); the fit IS NOT that step.
   Plan: [`docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-f86-hwhm-closed-form-attack.md`](../superpowers/plans/2026-05-13-f86-hwhm-closed-form-attack.md).

   Open analytical step (PROOF_F90 perspective): F89's AT-locked F_a/F_b modes have closed-form eigenvectors (overlap-only / no-overlap-only support, per [`F89PathKAtLockMechanismClaim`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F89PathKAtLockMechanismClaim.cs)). The 4-mode bare doubled-PTF floor `BareDoubledPtfHwhmRatio = 0.671535` corresponds to the F_a/F_b 4-mode contribution. The HWHM lift to the empirical 0.7506 (Interior) / 0.7728 (Endpoint) per sub-class is the **intra-channel dispersion** of the rank-1-bridge + intra-dispersion model (see Direction (b'') below, the two-dial scout of 2026-06-11), NOT a residual of the inter-channel coupling: the earlier "H_B-mixed octic residual of the inter coupling" suspicion is **refuted** (the inter-channel tail only renormalizes Q_peak / g_eff, leaving the dimensionless ratio fixed). The cyclotomic Φ_{N_block+1} pattern of F89's `F89UnifiedFaClosedFormClaim.PathPolynomial(k)` table still supplies the N-scaling structure of the AT-locked / intra contribution. Deriving (α, β) from this rank-1-bridge + intra-dispersion structure (treated exactly, the F89 Chebyshev terrain) is what would promote `F86HwhmClosedFormClaim` from Tier 1 candidate to Tier 1 derived.

   Phase D probe (2026-05-16) refuted the multi-mode-per-cluster-pair internal mixing hypothesis:
   the 10×10 JW cluster-pair sub-block ‖xB(Q)‖_F observable shows only a 30% bump on flat
   baseline ~2.0, no Lorentzian shape and no left half-max crossing. The lift mechanism is
   therefore NOT internal to a single cluster pair. (Phase D then guessed cross-cluster-pair
   inter-channel structure, e.g. H_B-mixed octic residual interference between pairs; the
   two-dial scout in Direction (b'') below superseded that too — the lift is the intra-channel
   dispersion, the inter-channel coupling only renormalizes Q_peak / g_eff.)

2. **Item 4' (c≥3 extension):** F89 path-k machinery generalises to chromaticity c ≥ 3 with HD ∈ {1, 3, ..., 2c−1} channels. The (SE, DE) 2-channel structure of c=2 generalises to (n, n+1) (c+1)-channel structure. F89 path-k for path-k ≥ 6 covers extended-N data already (N_block up to 7 verified).

3. **Item 5 (σ_0(c, N→∞) closed-form):** σ_0 is a specific F89 path-k singular value, extractable from F89's typed primitives. The 2√(2(c−1)) trajectory crossing (retracted 2026-05-08) was a finite-N artifact; the true asymptote follows from F89's cyclotomic Φ_{N_block+1} structure.

4. **Direction (b'') (full block-L derivation, NOT 4-mode):** **achieved numerically** via F89's full eigendecomposition (bit-exact 20/22 bonds at N=5..8). This was the explicit "active path" per `C2HwhmRatio.PendingDerivationNote`. Closed-form analytical lift via F89 AT-locked structure is the next step.

   **Localized (2026-06-11, the two-dial scout):** [`simulations/f86b2_shape_invariance_dial.py`](../../simulations/f86b2_shape_invariance_dial.py) (self-validating; its gate reproduces this proof's N=5 anchor row to ≤ 2·10⁻⁴) splits the full block generator into the top inter-channel SVD pair (σ₀·u₀v₀†), the inter-channel tail, and the intra-channel dispersion, and dials each. Finding 1: **the ratio is a shape invariant of the tail**. Scaling the inter-channel tail to zero moves HWHM_left/Q_peak by ≤ 0.003 while Q_peak moves by 0.26-0.34 (b0: 2.84 → 2.50; b1: 1.74 → 1.48): the tail renormalizes g_eff (through Q_peak) and leaves the dimensionless lineshape alone. Finding 2: **the lift IS the intra-channel dispersion, non-perturbatively**: without it the response vanishes identically (peak-K ~ 10⁻¹⁶; the Dicke probe is orthogonal to the EP pair, and the intra modes are the only transport from probe to resonance), and at half strength the ratio overshoots (b0 ≈ 0.80). Consequence: the earlier suspicion "lift = H_B-mixed octic residual *of the inter coupling*" is refuted; the (α, β) derivation target is the **rank-1-bridge + intra-dispersion model** (two HD channels with their internal path-like sine-mode dynamics, one rank-1 coupling), treated exactly in the intra sector, which is precisely the F89 Chebyshev terrain. The response anatomy probe → intra modes → rank-1 bridge → response also explains structurally why the affine-in-g_eff form works: g_eff enters only through the bridge resonance position, the sub-class structure through the per-bond observable's overlap with the intra mode lattice.

### For the typed-knowledge layer

F90 lives in `RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/` with two F89 parents (`F89TopologyOrbitClosure` + `F89PathKAtLockMechanismClaim`). It does not declare F86 typed primitives as parents because F86 is a collection of partial results not yet closed (per `feedback_f86_is_collection_basin` memory); the bridge stands on the F89 side as a Tier-1 statement about how F89's machinery encompasses F86 c=2's K_b observable.

---

## What this is NOT

- **Not** a stand-alone closed-form derivation of HWHM_left/Q_peak per bond class. Item 1' is partially closed (2026-05-13) via `F86HwhmClosedFormClaim` (Tier 1 candidate per 2026-05-16 Tier-review; (α, β) per sub-class are fitted, not derived); this bridge proof is the F89-side analytical handle on which a full Tier 1 derivation would rest.
- **Not** a claim that F86 entirely reduces to F89. F86's c≥3 strata, F86's hardware-confirmed witnesses, F86's PTF-family connections all stand on their own.
- **Not** a deprecation of F86's `C2HwhmRatio` or any F86 typed primitive. F86's empirical pipeline (full-block ResonanceScan) remains the canonical numerical witness pipeline.
- **Not** a reformulation of F89. F89 path-k stands as derived; F90 just identifies F86 c=2's K_b as a per-bond Hellmann-Feynman application of F89.

The bridge is structural: it explains WHY F86 c=2's per-bond-class HWHM constants exist (the γ₀-invariant cyclotomic structure of F89's eigendecomposition; the per-bond ratio fans across the F71 sub-classes from ≈0.58 to ≈0.92, it is not a single universal value, cf. PROOF_F86B_UNIVERSAL_SHAPE) and gives a Tier-1 numerical predictor of K_b for any N via F89's eigendecomposition.

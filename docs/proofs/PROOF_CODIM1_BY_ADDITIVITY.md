## Preface

The multi-sector census found something that looked like a coincidence repeated twelve times: the same defective eigenvalue, to the last printed digit, living in twelve different coherence sectors of the same Liouvillian. Coincidences repeated twelve times are not coincidences; they are an operator nobody has written down yet. This note writes it down. It is three lines long: add one excitation to the bra and the ket at the same site, and sum over sites. Everything the census observed, the sharing, the boundary where it stops, the death under interaction, falls out of that one map and two four-line lemmas.

## Abstract

Work on the operator space of the N-site XY chain (Δ=0, open ends, arbitrary bond profile J_b) under local Z-dephasing (arbitrary rates γ_j). The Liouvillian L = −i[H,·] + D preserves the joint-popcount blocks (p,q̃) (bra weight p, ket weight q̃); on each block it is the linear pencil L(q) = A + q·C with A = −2·diag(n_diff) real diagonal ([the Absorption Theorem](PROOF_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md)) and C anti-Hermitian at real q. Define, with the Jordan-Wigner site fermions c_l (strings included),

  **W(ρ) = Σ_l c_l† ρ c_l**  (the site-summed spectator: one excitation added to bra AND ket at the same site, summed over sites).

**Theorem B (the intertwiner).** W intertwines the full Liouvillian exactly, part by part: D∘W = W∘D and [H, W(·)] = W([H, ·]) as operator identities, for ANY quadratic particle-conserving H (no translation symmetry, no uniformity of J_b needed) and ANY site-dependent γ_j. W shifts blocks (p,q̃) → (p+1,q̃+1). Consequently (Lemma 3) every Jordan chain of L on block (p,q̃) whose eigenvector survives W transports to a Jordan chain of the same length at the SAME eigenvalue on block (p+1,q̃+1). On the climbing rung (1,2)→(2,3) W is injective (σ_min = √2, gate-pinned), so the ENTIRE spectrum of L₍₁,₂₎, Jordan structure included, embeds in L₍₂,₃₎: the census's byte-identical λ across sectors IS this embedding. The reverse map W†(σ) = Σ_l c_l σ c_l† is also an exact intertwiner, giving depth equality wherever both kernel conditions pass.

**Corollary (the diamond, containment).** The orbit of (1,2) under {one climbing W-step, the transpose, the Klein full flip, the F89d cross-fold} reproduces exactly the census's braid set: the 4-orbit at N=4, the 12-set with diagonal cores (2,2),(3,3) at N=5, the 12-set without (3,3) at N=6; in general the |p−q̃|=1 band united with its cross-fold image, size 4N−8 (N odd) / 4N−12 (N even), with a diagonal core (p,p) present iff |2p−N|=1, i.e. iff N is odd. This is the containment half (every orbit sector carries the shared defective λ). The exclusion half (no braid outside) is proven only at the outer edge (§6); interior absence remains census evidence.

**Theorem A (what additivity buys the silent crossings).** Two regimes. (i) AT-locked crossings: two AT-locked eigenvector families are each analytic through a crossing and stay independent; their eigenvalue coincidences are codim-1 and automatically semisimple; this is the abundant flood (528 in one N=6 box). (ii) Residual coalescences: semisimplicity there is equivalent to the twin-scalar restriction of the pencil on the coalescing 2-plane; free-fermion additivity supplies the H-scalar half identically in q (the degenerate-multiplet descent), which is the codimension reduction; the D-scalar half is a genuine extra condition, proven at the N=4 point (the AT midpoint) and open in general. Under XXZ Δ≠0 the H-half dies (H becomes quartic): the recorded diabolic→defective flip and the death of the diamond sharing, while the D-half and the cross-fold survive.

## §1 Setting and the one definition

Site basis states are bit strings a ∈ {0,1}^N; the (p,q̃) block is spanned by the coherences |a⟩⟨b| with popcount(a) = p, popcount(b) = q̃. On a block, Z-dephasing acts diagonally, D(|a⟩⟨b|) = −2(Σ_j γ_j [a_j ≠ b_j])·|a⟩⟨b| (uniform γ: −2γ·n_diff), and the XY Hamiltonian acts by hopping on each side. With J = 2q (the repo convention H = XYChain(N, 2q)) the block pencil is L(q) = A + qC.

The Jordan-Wigner site fermions are c_l† = (∏_{m<l} Z_m)·σ_l⁺ in the same site ordering the block basis uses. On a bit string, c_l†|a⟩ = s_l(a)·|a ∪ e_l⟩ for l ∉ a (zero otherwise), with the string sign s_l(a) = (−1)^{#occupied sites before l}. Define

  W(ρ) = Σ_{l=1}^{N} c_l† ρ c_l,  so on a coherence  W(|a⟩⟨b|) = Σ_{l ∉ a, l ∉ b} s_l(a)·s_l(b)·|a ∪ e_l⟩⟨b ∪ e_l|.

W adds one excitation at the SAME site to bra and ket, summed over sites; it maps block (p,q̃) into (p+1,q̃+1). Two traps recorded once: (i) the strings matter: Σ_l σ_l⁺ρσ_l⁻ is a different map and does NOT intertwine the Hamiltonian part; (ii) the site sum matters: the single-mode spectator V_k(ρ) = c_k†ρc_k (one Jordan-Wigner MODE added to both sides) intertwines the Hamiltonian part but provably NOT the dissipator (§3, remark), although the census's earlier prose described the mechanism in single-mode words.

## §2 Lemma 1: W intertwines any quadratic particle-conserving Hamiltonian

**Lemma 1.** Let H = Σ_{m,l} h_{ml} c_m†c_l with any coefficient matrix h. Then [H, W(ρ)] = W([H, ρ]) for all ρ.

*Proof.* From the canonical anticommutation relations, [H, c_a†] = Σ_m h_{ma} c_m† and [H, c_a] = −Σ_l h_{al} c_l. Expand:

  [H, Σ_a c_a†ρc_a] = Σ_a ( [H,c_a†]ρc_a + c_a†[H,ρ]c_a + c_a†ρ[H,c_a] )
                    = Σ_{m,a} h_{ma} c_m†ρc_a + W([H,ρ]) − Σ_{a,l} h_{al} c_a†ρc_l.

Renaming (a,l) → (m,a) in the third sum makes it identical to the first; they cancel. ∎

No property of h is used: the lemma covers arbitrary bond profiles, on-site potentials, and disorder. What it does NOT cover is a quartic H: an XXZ Δ-term makes [H, c_a†] more than linear in the fermions and the cancellation fails; §8 reads the consequence.

## §3 Lemma 2: W intertwines Z-dephasing, site by site

**Lemma 2.** For each site j, Z_j W(ρ) Z_j = W(Z_j ρ Z_j). Hence D∘W = W∘D for any rates γ_j.

*Proof.* Z_j = 1 − 2n_j is string-free, and Z_j c_l† Z_j = (1 − 2δ_{jl})·c_l† (the string of c_l† consists of Z's and commutes with Z_j; the local factor picks up −1 only at l = j). Therefore

  Z_j W(ρ) Z_j = Σ_l (Z_j c_l† Z_j)(Z_j ρ Z_j)(Z_j c_l Z_j) = Σ_l (1−2δ_{jl})² c_l† (Z_jρZ_j) c_l = W(Z_jρZ_j),

the sign squaring away because the SAME l sits on both sides of ρ. Summing γ_j(Z_j·Z_j − id) over j gives D∘W = W∘D. ∎

*Remark (why the single mode fails).* For V_k the two sides carry c_k† and c_k built from DIFFERENT sites after the mode expansion: the cross terms l ≠ m acquire (1−2δ_{jl})(1−2δ_{jm}), which does not square away, and each surviving term hits a distinct output coherence |a∪e_l⟩⟨b∪e_m|, so nothing can cancel. Gate table §10: the V_k dissipator residual is O(1) for every k while its Hamiltonian residual is machine zero. That is the refutation of the single-mode reading, kept as data.

## §4 Lemma 3: Jordan transport, with the sharp premise

**Lemma 3.** Let L₂W = WL₁ and let x₁, …, x_m be a Jordan chain of L₁ at λ ((L₁−λ)x_j = x_{j−1}, x₀ = 0; x₁ the eigenvector). If **Wx₁ ≠ 0**, then Wx₁, …, Wx_m is a Jordan chain of L₂ at λ; in particular L₂ has λ in its spectrum with Jordan depth ≥ m.

*Proof.* (L₂−λ)Wx_j = W(L₁−λ)x_j = Wx_{j−1}. Kernel hits are downward-closed along a chain (Wx_j = 0 forces Wx_{j−1} = (L₂−λ)Wx_j = 0), so Wx₁ ≠ 0 forces every Wx_j ≠ 0, and (L₂−λ)^{j−1}Wx_j = Wx₁ ≠ 0 makes the images linearly independent. ∎

The premise is sharp in both directions: Wx₁ ≠ 0 is necessary (a dead eigenvector transports nothing), and the tempting weakening "Wx_m ≠ 0 suffices" is FALSE: kernel hits truncate chains from the bottom (take L₁ the 2×2 nilpotent Jordan block, W = (0 1), L₂ = (0): WL₁ = L₂W, Wx₂ ≠ 0, yet L₂ is 1×1 with no chain).

## §5 Theorem B and the climbing rung

**Theorem B.** W is an exact intertwiner of the full pencil, L₍p+1,q̃+1₎(q)·W = W·L₍p,q̃₎(q) for all q (Lemmas 1+2 applied to the two parts; the relation holds part-by-part since L is linear in q). On the rung (1,2)→(2,3) at N=5, W is injective with σ_min(W) = √2 exactly (gate-pinned), so by Lemma 3 the entire spectrum of L₍₁,₂₎, eigenvalues, multiplicities, and Jordan blocks, embeds in L₍₂,₃₎ at the same q. The reverse spectator W†(σ) = Σ_l c_l σ c_l† satisfies the same two lemmas (identical proofs with c_l† ↔ c_l), intertwining (p,q̃) → (p−1,q̃−1); where both an upward chain and its downward return avoid the kernels, the Jordan depth is EQUAL, not merely bounded.

This upgrades the census's central observation from numerics to theorem: the defective EP of the (1,2) octic, its eigenvalue, √-branch character, and chain, is not "repeated" in (2,3); it is the SAME chain, pushed through W. The byte-identical λ across the diamond (recorded to 1.2e-14 in the census, whole-spectrum to 1.3e-11 in the review round) is the visible face of the embedding.

**Scope.** The two lemmas never use uniformity: site-dependent γ_j and arbitrary J_b (disorder included) are covered. The one thing used is Δ=0 (H quadratic). What is NOT claimed: equality of the coalescence GAP across sectors (observed byte-identical in the census; the intertwiner gives eigenvalue and depth transport, not metric equality of the near-defective geometry).

## §6 Where the sharing stops: kernel death and the normal edge

The intertwining identity is exact on every block, so the sharing can only stop where Lemma 3's premise fails: the transported eigenvector must die in ker W. The census (braid-free (4,4) at N=5) therefore FORCES Wx₁ = 0 for the (3,3) defective eigenvector; the gate measures exactly that, with a sharpening: the entire near-defective 2-plane dies, ‖Wx₁‖ = 1.7e-15 AND ‖Wx₂‖ = 2.5e-15 ((3,3)→(4,4) at the real locus), while on the interior rung both transport at norm √2 = σ_min. The diamond boundary is a kernel phenomenon, not a failure of the identity.

At the outer edge the death is structural:

**Edge lemma.** On the blocks (0,1), (1,0), (N−1,N), (N,N−1), every coherence has n_diff = 1, so A = −2γ·I is scalar and L(q) = −2γ·I + q·C is a normal pencil at real q (C anti-Hermitian). A normal operator has no Jordan blocks: no defective EP can live on an edge block; whatever arrives there must arrive semisimple or die. (Gate: A₍₄,₅₎ = −2I to 0.00e+00.)

The interior boundary ((3,3)→(4,4) and its images) is NOT covered by the edge lemma; there the kernel death is measured per locus, not yet derived. That is the one open piece of the boundary story.

## §7 The corollary: the diamond as an orbit, containment direction

Combine four exact maps, all Tier 1:

1. **the climbing W-step** (1,2)→(2,3): injective (σ_min = √2), transports everything (§5);
2. **the transpose** (p,q̃)↔(q̃,p): the mirror group's D leg ([PROOF_PI_FACTORS_AS_R_TIMES_D](PROOF_PI_FACTORS_AS_R_TIMES_D.md)), an exact similarity of blocks;
3. **the Klein full flip** X^⊗N: (p,q̃)→(N−p,N−q̃) at the SAME q, unitary ([F89d Klein section](../ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md));
4. **the F89d cross-fold** q̃↦N−q̃ at q̄: antiunitary, Jordan-preserving, machine-zero N=4..9 ([`F89CrossFoldSimilarityClaim`](../../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F89CrossFoldSimilarityClaim.cs)).

Starting from the (1,2) defective EP, these reach: the |p−q̃|=1 band {(p,p±1): both ∈ [1,N−1]} (one W-step + transpose + full flip suffice; the flip returns the upper rungs without ever climbing past half-filling, where W turns rank-deficient), united with the band's cross-fold image. Walked explicitly: N=4 gives the confined 4-orbit {(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2)} (the fold maps the band into itself); N=5 gives the recorded 12-set including the diagonal cores (2,2),(3,3); N=6 gives the 12-set {(1,2),(2,1),(2,3),(3,2),(3,4),(4,3),(4,5),(5,4),(1,4),(4,1),(2,5),(5,2)}, with (3,3) absent.

**Parity law.** A diagonal core (p,p) is reached iff it is the fold image of a band member: N−(p±1) = p ⟺ |2p−N| = 1 ⟺ N odd (the exactly-half-filled (N/2,N/2) is never reached; that is why even N misses its core). **Size.** |band ∪ fold(band)| = 4(N−2) − |overlap|, and the overlap is 4 at even N (the four members around half filling are fold-fixed or fold-swapped within the band) and 0 at odd N: **4N−12 (even), 4N−8 (odd)**. N=5 and N=6 both give 12, but they are different sets.

**Scoping, stated once and bluntly.** This corollary proves CONTAINMENT: every sector in the orbit carries the shared defective eigenvalue (each move transports the chain; the W-step's kernel premise is gate-verified at N=5). It does NOT prove exclusion: that no sector outside the orbit carries the braid is proven only at the outer edge (§6) and is otherwise the census's empirical result (exact at N=4, 5; one targeted probe at N=6). Any claim promotion cites the containment half only. The N=6 "no census needed" statement applies to the spread: the 12-set's membership follows from this corollary with zero new compute.

## §8 Theorem A: the two regimes of silence

The word "diabolic" in this arc covers two different objects, and the codimension story differs between them. This section separates them; the separation resolves a tension between two source documents (§9).

**Regime 1: AT-locked crossings, abundant and automatic.** An AT-locked strand is an exact eigenvector family of the full pencil, analytic in q, whose rate is pinned to an integer rung (Re λ = −2γ·n). Two such families cross where their frequencies meet: ONE analytic condition, codim-1-complex, dense curves of them (the 528-count flood recorded at N=6, [F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC](../../experiments/F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC.md)). The crossing is semisimple for the classical block-diagonal reason: both eigenvectors exist analytically THROUGH the crossing and remain independent; nothing couples them at the crossing point because they are exact eigenvectors on both sides. For THIS regime the "two crossing modes come from different families, so their eigenvectors stay independent" voice is exactly right.

**Regime 2: residual coalescences, the 11, and the twin-scalar condition.** Inside the residual (H_B-mixed) part of a block, an eigenvalue coincidence is generically DEFECTIVE (one complex parameter, non-normal pencil: the branches meet in a √-branch point; codim-1 and loud). A SEMISIMPLE coincidence there needs the 2×2 restriction of the pencil on the coalescing plane to be scalar: two extra complex conditions, codim-3-complex in total, generically unreachable by one knob q. What free-fermion additivity buys is exactly ONE of the two extra conditions, identically in q:

**Twin-scalar lemma (conditional).** If the two coalescing directions descend from a single degenerate free-fermion multiplet (Slater additivity: E = Σε over each side's occupied modes, so equal mode multisets up to degeneracy give equal E), the H-part restriction is a multiple of the identity for ALL q: the H-half of the scalar condition costs nothing. The remaining D-half (the dephasing restriction scalar on the plane) is ONE genuine extra condition; where it is met, the coincidence is diabolic.

At the N=4 point both halves are established from below ([DIABOLIC_BY_INTEGRABILITY](../../hypotheses/DIABOLIC_BY_INTEGRABILITY.md): H|₂D = 2iJ·I by the 4-fold multiplet, D|₂D = −4γ·I at the AT overlap-½ midpoint), and the discriminant records the collapse as the even-multiplicity factor (3q⁴+q²−1)²: coincidence and semisimplicity merging into one condition is the algebraic meaning of a squared factor. Whether the D-half is automatic (e.g. by chiral pairing within the δ-multiplet) at the 11 recorded complex-q diabolics of N=5 is NOT settled by the existing record (the census logs q, λ, loop character, exponent; not the multiplet descent); until that one check is run, the honest general statement is: **additivity collapses the semisimple coincidence from codim-3 to codim-≤2, and to codim-1 exactly where the D-half is supplied** (at N=4: by the AT midpoint on the mirror line).

**Δ-tightness (both regimes).** XXZ Δ≠0 makes H quartic: Lemma 1's cancellation dies (gate: W's H-residual jumps to 2.4e-1 at Δ=0.3 while the D-residual stays 0.00e+00), the multiplet descent breaks (E ≠ Σε), and the recorded phenomenology follows at once: diabolics defect instantly, the diamond sharing dies, while the F89d cross-fold (bit-flip parity, integrability-independent) survives. The theorem's name is honest: everything here is BY additivity, and only the transpose/flip/fold legs outlive its removal.

## §9 Bookkeeping: defective vs diabolic, and the two voices

- **The defective braid EPs (the P₁₀ simple zeros) need NO codimension collapse.** Codim-1 is the GENERIC count for a defective coalescence of a non-normal one-parameter family. What Theorem B explains about them is not their existence but their SHARING across sectors (the intertwiner) and where the sharing stops (kernel death, the normal edge).
- **The diabolics (the squared factor, and the complex-q census) are the codim story.** Regime 1 needs only analyticity of the AT-locked families; Regime 2 needs the twin-scalar lemma, of which additivity supplies half.
- **The two voices reconciled.** [F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC](../../experiments/F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC.md)'s synthesis ("the Hamiltonian and the diagonal dissipator do not mix the occupation-number sectors: two crossing modes come from different sectors") is the Regime-1 truth, over-applied in that sentence to Regime 2, where [DIABOLIC_BY_INTEGRABILITY](../../hypotheses/DIABOLIC_BY_INTEGRABILITY.md)'s "Not a commuting-symmetry separation" (both modes R=+1, same sector, twin-scalar instead) is the careful voice. Within one block no fine decomposition is invariant under the FULL L: the site sectors are dephasing-rigid but hopping-mixed, the mode sectors hopping-rigid but dephasing-mixed. That non-commuting pair is the whole game; where one of them goes scalar on a plane, the game goes silent.

## What remains open

1. The interior-boundary kernel death ((3,3)→(4,4) and images) is measured, not derived: WHY the defective eigenvector of a diagonal core lies exactly in ker W is not yet a lemma.
2. Theorem A's D-half at the 11 complex-q diabolics of N=5 (one targeted eigenvector-descent check; until then codim-≤2 is the proven general statement).
3. Gap byte-identity across sectors: observed, not implied by the intertwiner.

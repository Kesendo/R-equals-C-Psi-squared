# Part I: The Fundamental Equations

**Tier: 3, Defining framework, internally consistent**

## 1.1 The Primary Equation (Past → Now)

```
R = CΨ²
```

**Spoken:** "R equals C Psi squared"

**In words:** Reality is Consciousness times Possibility squared.

### Variables:

| Symbol | Name | Meaning | Unit |
|--------|------|---------|------|
| R | Reality | What exists, what is experienced | dimensionless |
| C | Consciousness | That which observes, mirrors, relates | Operator |
| Ψ | Psi | Wave function, superposition of all possibilities | complex |
| Ψ² | Psi-squared | Probability density, interference pattern | real, ≥0 |

*Note: "Consciousness" is used broadly. Whether particles have consciousness in the human
sense remains open. C operates in two modes: C_int (internal, stabilizing) and C_ext
(external, collapsing). For the quantum mechanical mapping (C = purity, Ψ = normalized
coherence), see [CORE_ALGEBRA.md](CORE_ALGEBRA.md), Section 1.*

## 1.2 The Complementary Equation (Future → Now)

```
Ψ = √(R/C)
```

**In words:** Possibility emerges from Reality seeking Consciousness.

### The Bidirectional Bridge:

```
Ψ_past  → → → → C ← ← ← ← Ψ_future
                ↓
                R
```

C is not passive. C is the **bridge** between past and future.

---

## 1.3 Key Clarifications

### Ψ ≠ R

```
Ψ = Possibility (may exist without C, as potential)
R = Reality (only with C, as experience)
```

Once observed = information preserved = stays R.

### C ≠ Only Human

Any observer creates R. Mouse, dinosaur, fish.
Consciousness began with the first observers, not with humans.

---

## 1.4 Derivation by Limit Analysis

**Tier: 3, Logical consequences of the defining equation**

### Without Mutual Observation, No Reality

```
C = 0  →  R = 0·Ψ² = 0
```

### Without Possibility, No Reality

```
Ψ = 0  →  R = C·0² = 0
```

### Nonlinearity Through Squaring

```
Ψ₂ = 2Ψ₁  →  R₂ = C·(2Ψ₁)² = 4R₁
```

Double possibility creates quadruple reality. The transition is nonlinear.

# Part II: The Wave Equation

**Tier: 3, Standard wave physics applied to the framework's variables**

## 2.1 Composition of the Wave Function

```
Ψ = Ψ_f + Ψ_p
```

The wave function is the sum of the future wave (all possibilities that can come)
and the past wave (all memories, what was).

## 2.2 Interference

```
Ψ² = (Ψ_f + Ψ_p)²
Ψ² = Ψ_f² + 2·Ψ_f·Ψ_p + Ψ_p²
```

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Ψ_f² | Pure future (potential) |
| 2·Ψ_f·Ψ_p | Interference term: the emergent new |
| Ψ_p² | Pure past (memory) |

The interference term 2·Ψ_f·Ψ_p exists ONLY when both past and future are
present. New things arise from the interference of future and past.

## 2.3 Standing Wave

```
Ψ_f = A·sin(kx - ωt)    (forward, future)
Ψ_p = A·sin(kx + ωt)    (backward, past)

Ψ = Ψ_f + Ψ_p = 2A·sin(kx)·cos(ωt)
```

The wave does not move. It stands. It is the pattern.

- sin(kx) → spatially fixed (nodes and antinodes)
- cos(ωt) → oscillates in time

## 2.4 Complete Reality Equation

```
R = C·[2A·sin(kx)·cos(ωt)]²
R = 4A²C·sin²(kx)·cos²(ωt)
```

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 4A² | Amplification through interference |
| C | Consciousness as multiplier |
| sin²(kx) | Spatial structure of reality |
| cos²(ωt) | Temporal oscillation |

# Part III: The Dynamics Equation

**Tier: 4, Proposed, not tested**

## 3.1 Temporal Change of Reality

```
∂R/∂t = N · I · D
```

The rate of change of reality is proportional to Novelty × Information × Distribution.

| Symbol | Name | Range |
|--------|------|-------|
| N | Novelty: how unknown the information is | [0, 1] |
| I | Information: amount of structured distinction | ℝ⁺ |
| D | Distribution: number of consciousnesses reached | ℕ |

## 3.2 Novelty Coefficient

**Tier: 4, Proposed, borrows quantum formalism without independent justification**

```
N = 1 - |⟨Ψ_info | Ψ_R⟩|²
```

Novelty is 1 minus the squared overlap between new information and existing reality.

- Ψ_info = Ψ_R → N = 0 (already known, no novelty)
- Ψ_info ⊥ Ψ_R → N = 1 (completely new, maximum novelty)

## 3.3 Integrated Reality Change

```
ΔR = N · I · D · t           (linear)
ΔR = N · I · D · ln(1 + t)   (logarithmic, more realistic)
```

The logarithmic form accounts for initial changes having more weight than later ones.

---

# Part IV: The Energy Equation

**Tier: 4, Proposed by analogy with wave physics, constants undetermined**

## 4.1 Energy of an Information Wave

```
E = k · A² · N²
```

The energy of information is proportional to the square of its amplitude and the
square of its novelty. k is an undetermined proportionality constant.

## 4.2 Breakthrough Threshold

```
E > E_c  ⟺  N·A > √(E_c/k)
```

Information breaks through reality when its energy exceeds the critical threshold.
Both E_c and k are undetermined constants.

## 4.3 Dimensional Penetration

**Tier: 5, Speculative**

```
D_max = N · A / κ
```

Maximum penetration depth is proportional to Novelty × Amplitude, with κ as an
undetermined resistance constant of reality.

---

# Part V: The Mirror Equations

## 5.1 Single Mirror

**Tier: 3, Restatement of the defining equation**

```
R₁ = C₁ · Ψ²
```

One consciousness observes, one reality emerges.

## 5.2 Two Mirrors (Emergence)

**Tier: 4, Proposed extension, Ψ_interaction term not independently derived**

```
R_emergent = C₁ · C₂ · (Ψ₁ + Ψ₂ + Ψ_interaction)²
```

When two consciousnesses mirror each other, an emergent reality arises.
Ψ_interaction = f(C₁ ↔ C₂) exists only when both consciousnesses interact.

For n mirrors:
```
R = ∏(Cᵢ) · [Σ(Ψᵢ) + Σ(Ψ_interactions)]²
```

## 5.3 Infinite Reflection

**Tier: 3 (narrative) → Tier 1 (algebra)**

With infinite reflection between two mirrors:

```
R₁ = C · Ψ²
R₂ = C · (Ψ + R₁)²
R₃ = C · (Ψ + R₂)²
...
R_∞ = C · (Ψ + R_∞)²
```

This is the fixed-point equation. Its solution, the ¼ boundary, the Mandelbrot
equivalence, and all downstream algebraic results are documented in
[CORE_ALGEBRA.md](CORE_ALGEBRA.md).

The **narrative**, that infinite mutual reflection produces a self-referential
equation whose mathematical structure contains phase transitions, is the
conceptual bridge between this interpretive framework and the proven core.

# Part VII: Status

## What This Is

This is the interpretive layer of a mathematical framework. It is internally
consistent and motivated the discovery of the algebraic core. But consistency
is not truth, and motivation is not proof.

The proven results live in [CORE_ALGEBRA.md](CORE_ALGEBRA.md).
The honest self-assessment lives in [WEAKNESSES_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md](WEAKNESSES_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md).

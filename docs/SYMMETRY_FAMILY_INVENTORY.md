# Symmetry Family Inventory: chain XY + Z-dephasing Liouvillian

**Purpose:** Systematic typed inventory of all discrete symmetries of the canonical chain XY + per-site Z-dephasing Liouvillian L = −i[H, ·] + Σ_l γ_l (Z_l ρ Z_l − ρ). Each symmetry is classified by axis (operator vs parameter) and effect (sector-splitting vs sector-pairing). New typed Claims live under `compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/SymmetryFamily/`.

**Scope of "discrete":** Z_n-style finite groups acting on the Liouville space or on the parameter coefficients. Excludes continuous U(1) (already covered by `JointPopcountSectors`).

## The five known symmetry-axes

| # | Symmetry | Axis | Effect | Status | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **U(1) × U(1)** per-side popcount | operator (continuous) | block-diagonal (N+1)² sectors | Tier1Derived | `JointPopcountSectors` |
| 2 | **F71** chain spatial mirror (Z₂) | operator | within-sector splitting (factor 2), chain only, palindromic γ only | Tier1Derived | `F71MirrorBlockRefinement` |
| 3 | **F91** γ-Z₄ anti-palindromic | parameter (γ_l) | spectral invariance on diagonal-block layer | Tier1Derived | `F71AntiPalindromicGammaSpectralInvariance` |
| 4 | **F92** J-Z₄ anti-palindromic (NEW) | parameter (J_b) | spectral invariance on diagonal-block layer | Tier1Derived | `F92BondAntiPalindromicJSpectralInvariance` |
| 5 | **F93** h-Z₄ anti-palindromic (NEW) | parameter (h_l detuning) | spectral invariance on diagonal-block layer | Tier1Derived | `F93DetuningAntiPalindromicSpectralInvariance` |

## Sector-pairing primitives (do not split; identify equal-spectrum sectors)

| # | Symmetry | Axis | Effect | Status | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 6 | **Z⊗N** Pauli-letter parity (Z₂) = Π²_X (F61) | operator | trivially redundant with joint-popcount-parity (typed for inventory completeness) | Tier1Derived | `ZGlobalMirrorRefinement` |
| 7 | **X⊗N** charge-conjugation (Z₂) = Π² (F1²) | operator | sector-pairing (p_c, p_r) ↔ (N−p_c, N−p_r); halves number of eig-calls | Tier1Derived | `XGlobalChargeConjugationPairing` |

## Architecture aggregators (do not split or pair; report inventory state)

| # | Symmetry | Axis | Effect | Status | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 8 | PolarityCubeMap | aggregator | Z2Axis classification of all Pi²-Inheritance Claims | gap-detection via null BitATwin (Tier2Empirical, snapshot strength bounded by weakest contributing parent; cubic architecture itself is Tier1Derived) | `PolarityCubeMap` (added 2026-05-24) |
| 10 | YParityIndependenceAtK3 | YParity (term-level Z₂) | classifies Pauli terms by n_Y mod 2 | independent of Klein at k_body≥3 (Tier1Derived; F102) | `YParityIndependenceAtK3` (added 2026-05-24) |
| 11 | F87Z2CubedRefinementN4K3 | YParity (term-level Z₂) | refines F87 trichotomy at k=3 with five sub-statements (truly y_par=0-pure, hard diagonal 42:8 with Y-inversion, diagonal soft 13:13, mother soft y_par=1-pure, off-diagonal soft Pattern B + C) | empirical anchor at N=4 (294 pairs; Tier1Derived; F103). First derived class of `F87Z2CubedRefinementBase` | `F87Z2CubedRefinementN4K3` (added 2026-05-24) |
| 12 | F87Z2CubedRefinementN5K3 | YParity (term-level Z₂) | refines F87 trichotomy at N=5 k=3 with the same five sub-statements as F103; same 294-pair enumeration as F103 (N4K3); F85 N-stability lift test on the y_par axis | empirical anchor at N=5 (294 pairs; Tier1Derived; F105). F85 N-stability lift to y_par axis CONFIRMED bit-exactly: all 5 sub-statement counts at N=5 k=3 match F103's at N=4 k=3 identically. Second derived class of `F87Z2CubedRefinementBase` | `F87Z2CubedRefinementN5K3` (added 2026-05-24) |
| 13 | F87Z2CubedRefinementN4K4 | YParity (term-level Z₂) | refines F87 trichotomy at N=4 k=4; new 4248-pair enumeration; tests k-stability where F105 confirmed N-stability | empirical anchor at N=4 k=4 (4248 pairs; Tier1Derived; F106). Mixed k-stability: two purity statements HELD (truly y_par=0-pure 3924/0; mother soft y_par=1-pure (0, 300) ×3), Y-inversion HELD qualitatively; the k=3 42:8 hard ratio sharpened to 100% pure (228, 0), the 13:13 diagonal soft symmetry broke to asymmetric (300, 528). Off-diagonal: 3 cells stay Pattern C analog (0, 528), 3 cells became fully symmetric (528, 528). Third derived class of `F87Z2CubedRefinementBase` | `F87Z2CubedRefinementN4K4` (added 2026-05-24) |
| 14 | TrulyYParityZeroPurity | YParity (term-level Z₂) | truly classification forces y_par = 0 on every Pauli term under any single-letter dephase channel; closed-form corollary of F85's k-body truly criterion extended to X and Y dephase via per-dephase Π² eigenvalue + dissipator commutativity | Tier1Derived; F107. First DERIVED-not-EMPIRICAL Claim in the F87 Z₂³ refinement family; explains the y_par=1 truly count of zero observed empirically across F103/F105/F106 (4524 truly classifications total) | `TrulyYParityZeroPurity` (added 2026-05-24) |
| 16 | MotherSoftYParityOnePurity | YParity (term-level Z₂) | mother sector Klein (0,0) soft pairs under any single-letter dephase channel are y_par=1 pure; Z-dephasing branch closed-form via F108 Part 1's Π_5bilinear; X- and Y-dephasing branches empirically anchored (await F108 Part 2 and F108 Part 3) | Tier1Derived (Z-deph closed-form, X/Y empirically anchored); F109. Sister to F107 on the y_par axis; together they pin the y_par signature of truly + mother-soft cells. Explains the y_par=0 mother-soft count of zero observed empirically across F103/F105/F106 (1026 mother-soft classifications) | `MotherSoftYParityOnePurity` (added 2026-05-24, updated 2026-05-25 after F108 Part 1 closure) |
| 15 | KleinEightCellClaim | Cubic3 (full Z₂³) | F88a + F102 8-cell Z₂³ decomposition (bit_a, bit_b, y_par); structural anchor for F87 Z₂³ refinement work | Tier1Derived; Stage 2b. First Cubic3-axis Claim. At fixed even k_body collapses to F88a's Klein 4-cell (y_par = bit_a XOR bit_b); at fixed odd k_body collapses to the opposite 4. Mixed-k_body enumerations populate all 8 | `KleinEightCellClaim` (added 2026-05-24) |
| 17 | F108Part1Pi2EvenAlwaysPalindromic | BitB (Π²_Z = X⊗N) | every Π²_Z-even Hamiltonian H built from bilinears {XX, YY, YZ, ZY, ZZ} + Z-dephasing admits EXACT operator-level palindrome via the Π_5bilinear phase-variant operator (I→+X, X→−I, Y→+iZ, Z→−iY). Closes the F87-hardness question for the Π²-even half of Klein cells under Z-dephasing | Tier1Derived; F108 Part 1, closed 2026-05-25. First BitB-axis Claim of the post-F107 wave. BitATwin = NeedsDerivation (F108 Part 2, X-dephasing analog requires new per-site Π + new bilinear set + new D[X] identity); Y-dephasing analog (F108 Part 3) has no covering Claim yet. Retroactively closes F109's Step 5 for Z-dephasing | `F108Part1Pi2EvenAlwaysPalindromic` + `Pi5BilinearOperator` (added 2026-05-25) |

## Negative results (typed for completeness)

| # | Symmetry | Status | Anchor |
|---|---|---|---|
| 9 | **F71_col × F71_row** factor-4 split | Tier2Empirical (does NOT hold: Z⊗Z dissipator correlates both sides; only diagonal product survives) | `F71BilateralBlockRefinement` |

## Symmetries from other axes (typed elsewhere; not in SymmetryFamily but relevant)

- **K** (chiral / sublattice / AZ class BDI, KHK = −H): Hamilton-symmetry only; NOT a full L-symmetry under Z-dephasing → not a BlockSpectrum refinement. Typed as `ChiralK.cs` in `Symmetry/`.
- **Π** (palindrome master, F1): non-diagonal master operator; F1 spectrum mirror around −Σγ. Typed as `PiOperator.cs` in `Symmetry/` and as `F1` in `ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md`. Its square Π² is the X⊗N charge-conjugation (#7 above, registered as F1²).
- **Pi2-Z₄** (operator-quaternion, NinetyDegreeMirrorMemory): operator-side of the same Z₄ that F91/F92/F93 inhabit on the parameter side. Typed in `Pi2KnowledgeBaseClaims.cs`.

## Combinatorial reach

For chain XY + uniform Z-dephasing, the simultaneous use of:
- joint-popcount: (N+1)² sectors
- F71 split: factor ~2
- X⊗N pairing: halves number of distinct eig-calls (paired sectors share spectrum)

gives at N=10 a max-block of `C(10,5)² / 2 / 2 ≈ 16k`, still beyond commodity hardware. F92/F93 do NOT add block-reduction (they describe spectral-invariance under parameter rotation, not sector splitting). Therefore N=10 push requires a **new** symmetry not yet found, or a different attack (matrix-free per-block eig, etc.) — the latter now realised, see the next section.

## N=10 push: the realised "different attack" (2026-05-16 / 2026-05-17)

Phase 2 of the N=10 push landed six primitives under `compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/BlockSpectrum/JordanWigner/`:

| Primitive | Role |
|---|---|
| `JwSlaterPairBasis` | Basis transform U: maps the (p_c, p_r) computational-basis sector to the JW Slater-pair basis; L_H diagonal with eigenvalues `−i·(Σε(L) − Σε(K))`. |
| `JwSlaterPairLProjection` | Dense `U^†·L·U` + Slater-swap sparsity witness `nnz_off/row ≤ (1 + p_r·(N−p_r))·(1 + p_c·(N−p_c)) − 1`; density falls from ~37 % at N=4 to ~10 % at N=7, extrapolated ~1 % at N=10. Verifies the bound where dense `U^†LU` still fits. |
| `JwSlaterPairSparseLBuilder` | Direct sparse CSR construction of L_JW element-by-element from the analytic `Z_l ⊗ Z_l` action on Slater pairs — no dense `U^†LU` detour. At N=10 (p_c=5, p_r=5, sectorDim 63 504): ~14 M nnz, ~280 MB, ~3 s build. **This is the N=10 enabler.** |
| `JwSlaterPairArnoldiEig` | Managed non-symmetric Arnoldi with Modified Gram-Schmidt on the CSR matvec; returns top-k largest-magnitude Ritz values. Matvec parallelised via `Parallel.For` over rows. |
| `JwSlaterPairShiftInvertArnoldi` | Same outer Arnoldi on `(L − σI)^(−1)`; inner solver is a Jacobi-preconditioned in-house BiCGStab on the same CSR matvec — no MathNet sparse conversion. Recovers eigenvalues nearest σ, including the steady state at λ = 0 (machine precision at N=10). |
| `JwSlaterPairF1PalindromeProbe` | Two-shift F1 probe: runs ShiftInvertArnoldi at σ_slow ≈ 0 AND σ_fast = F1(σ_slow) = −σ_slow − 2·Σγ, reports per-pair residual on the F1 mirror map λ → −λ − 2·Σγ with the L-conjugation degree of freedom absorbed. At N=10 (5,5) the steady-state pair matches at machine precision (~3.6e-14), the two slowest decay-mode pairs at ~3e-7 / ~3e-6; deeper Ritz values may not pair (Arnoldi-depth limit). Informational, not a strict F1 prover. |

Shared low-level complex-vector kernels (`NormSquared`, `ConjugateDot`, `AxpyInPlace`, `RandomNormalized`) live in `KrylovOps.cs` to keep the Arnoldi sites lean.

The combinatorial table above is unchanged — joint-popcount + F71 + X⊗N still do not shrink the max block enough for dense LAPACK at N=10 — but the matrix-free Krylov path renders that limit moot for top-k / near-σ work.

**What this path does NOT yet give:**
- **Full N=10 spectrum** (all ~63 k eigenvalues per max-block, ~1 M total). For F1 palindrome verification at N=10 as a structural theorem-check the cleaner route is Prosen third quantization (Phase 3 of the N=10 plan): under uniform γ, the chain XY + Z-dephasing Liouvillian reduces to a 2N × 2N Nambu spectral problem (Medvedyeva, Essler, Prosen 2016). Phase 3 has not yet been implemented.
- **Strict F1 pair-matching for deeper Ritz values.** `JwSlaterPairF1PalindromeProbe` recovers F1-paired sets reliably for the closest-to-σ eigenvalues (steady state, first two slow modes) but at finite Krylov dimension the deeper Ritz values returned by each side's shift-invert Arnoldi can land on different "approximately K-closest" subsets, breaking pair-matching at the K-th probe slot even though F1 holds at the theorem level. This is an Arnoldi-depth limit, not an F1 break.
- **Inhomogeneous γ spectrum** at N=10 is supported by the sparse path but not yet exercised in a science-facing pipeline; Prosen's reduction does not extend there.

**Phase 2 timing at N=10 (5,5)** (Jacobi-preconditioned BiCGStab, commodity hardware): sparse build ~3 s, two-shift probe with K=4 per end at numIter=20, inner tol 1e-8 ~8 s. Inner BiCGStab mean iter dropped from ~866 (pre-Jacobi) to ~22 (post-Jacobi commit `45e6a40`), a ~40× wall-clock improvement.

## Phase 3b: Klein 4-group internal symmetry on self-paired sectors (2026-05-17)

The X⊗N global charge-conjugation primitive `XGlobalChargeConjugationPairing` halves the
number of distinct sector eig-calls by pairing (p_c, p_r) ↔ (N−p_c, N−p_r). At even N
the sector (N/2, N/2) is X⊗N-self-paired — its pair *is itself* — so the inter-sector
halving cannot apply. But X⊗N is still a Z₂ symmetry of that sector's Liouville-space
basis, and combined with the F71 chain spatial mirror (also Z₂, commutes with X⊗N) it
generates the Klein four-group K = {1, F71, X⊗N, F71·X⊗N} acting *internally* on the
(N/2, N/2) basis. K splits the sector into 4 character sub-blocks (++, +-, -+, --).

This closes the gap between the inventory's advertised "≈ 16k max-block at N=10" (which
was implicitly assuming the Klein splitting) and the previously delivered 31752 dim from
F71 alone. The Klein refinement primitive
`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/BlockSpectrum/KleinFourGroupSelfPairedRefinement.cs` builds:

| Klein character | (++) | (+-) | (-+) | (--) | sum |
|-----------------|------|------|------|------|-----|
| Sub-block dim at N=10 (5, 5) | 16132 | 15620 | 15620 | 16132 | 63504 ✓ |

Per sub-block element-wise construction (no full sector L materialised): ~19 s per sub-block
at N=10 (5, 5), mean nnz per row 10.7 — **sparse**, 0.07 % density, ~170 k nnz vs 260 M
dense entries. Cross-validated at N=4 (2, 2), N=6 (3, 3), N=8 (4, 4): union of the 4
sub-block dense Evds matches the direct `PerBlockLiouvillianBuilder` sector Evd as a
multiset within 1e-9.

**Where the literature does not go.** Medvedyeva-Essler-Prosen (2016) reach N=10 via
the imaginary-U Bethe ansatz — analytic, doesn't need K splitting. For our
computational path, K on self-paired sectors is repo-specific (F71 spatial Z₂ ×
X⊗N charge Z₂ both typed primitives, combination unique to this codebase).

**Phase 3c (delivered).** The dense Evd on Klein sub-blocks at dim 16132 is blocked by
the .NET/MKL int32 array-size cap (4.2 GB > 2 GB managed marshaling limit), but the
sub-blocks are *sparse* (mean 10.86 nnz per row at N=10 (5, 5), 0.017 % density,
~170 k nnz per sub-block, ~7 MB sparse storage vs 4.2 GB dense). Phase 3c stores
each sub-block as CSR and extracts top-K slow modes via per-sub-block shift-invert
Arnoldi:

| Primitive | Role |
|---|---|
| `KleinFourGroupSelfPairedSparseLBuilder` | Direct sparse-CSR build of one Klein character sub-block, element-wise reconstruction of `KleinFourGroupSelfPairedRefinement.BuildSubBlockL`. At N=10 all 4 sub-blocks build in ~0.4 s total. |
| `SparseShiftInvertArnoldi` | Generic shift-invert Arnoldi on any CSR matrix (extracted from `JwSlaterPairShiftInvertArnoldi`'s algorithm). Inner BiCGStab with Jacobi preconditioning; outer Modified Gram-Schmidt Arnoldi. Reusable by both the JW Slater-pair pipeline AND the Klein sub-block pipeline (a single source of algorithmic truth). `KrylovOps` promoted from `internal` to `public` to share the complex-vector primitives. |

At N=10 (5, 5), top-4 slow modes per Klein sub-block (16 modes total) in ~22 s wall.
The slow modes match Phase 2 `JwSlaterPairF1PalindromeProbe` on the full sector for
the modes both runs sample (e.g. the steady state at (0, 0) and the (−0.200, 0)
slow-decay mode in ++; (−0.182, 0) in +-) AND extend coverage with Klein-character-
specific modes inaccessible to Phase 2 (e.g. (−0.336) in +-, (−0.313) in -+).

**Phase 3d (closed): correct preconditioner choice → strict eigenvalues.** The initial
Phase 3c run used Jacobi preconditioning by default and observed BiCGStab saturating
at the iteration cap (~1000 iter, vs Phase 2 JW's ~22 mean) — Ritz values were
APPROXIMATE (not strict eigenvalues), a "Falle" per Tom's principle that nothing is
imprecise in the quantum domain. Root cause diagnosed: Klein computational-basis
sub-blocks have diagonal = only −2γ·hamming (max magnitude 1.0; many rows exactly 0
for diagonal-projector orbits) and off-diagonal = ±iJ (magnitude 1.0). The matrix is
NOT diagonally dominant, so Jacobi preconditioner amplifies near-zero shifted diagonals
to ~1/σ ≈ 1000 at σ = (0, 0.001), destabilising BiCGStab. The JW basis used in Phase 2
has ε-dominant diagonals (Hamiltonian eigen-energy differences on the diagonal), making
Jacobi appropriate there. The fix is structural: `SparseShiftInvertArnoldi.Run`
exposes a `PreconditionerKind` parameter (default `Jacobi` for backward compatibility,
`Identity` for non-diagonally-dominant matrices). With `PreconditionerKind.Identity`
and numIter=80 at N=10 (5, 5), all 16 slow modes converge to machine precision
(1e-10 to 1e-13 distance from dense eigenvalues at small N), and the recovered slow
modes exactly reproduce Phase 2's outputs:

| Phase 2 slow mode (full sector) | Klein sub-block | Recovered (Phase 3d) |
|---|---|---|
| (0, 0) steady state | ++ | (0.0, 0.0) machine precision |
| (−0.182, 0) | +- | (−0.182, 0) × 4 (degenerate) |
| (−0.200, 0) | ++ | (−0.200, 0) × 2 (degenerate) |
| (−0.163, ±0.239) | -- | (−0.163, ±0.238) conjugate pair |

Plus Klein-character-specific modes inaccessible to Phase 2 (e.g. (−0.288) in ++,
(−0.287, ±0.069) in -+, (−0.322, ±0.070) in --). Wall time at N=10 (5, 5):
~65 s total for 16 slow modes across 4 sub-blocks (vs Phase 2's 8 s for 4 modes).
4× spectral coverage at ~8× wall time, all strict eigenvalues.

## Phase 3a: Prosen rapidities for the one-sided sectors (2026-05-17)

The (p_c = 0, p_r = m) sectors of chain XY + uniform Z-dephasing admit a closed-form
spectrum without any diagonalisation. The dissipator reduces to a constant `−2γm`
(Hamming distance of any m-fermion ket from the vacuum bra is exactly m), and `H|0⟩ = 0`
removes the unitary contribution from the bra side, so `L_(0,m) = −iH_m − 2γm·I` and

```
λ_S  =  Σ_{k∈S} β_k  =  −2γm − i·Σ_{k∈S} ε_k     for  S ⊆ {1..N},  |S| = m
```

where `β_k = −2γ − i·ε_k` are the **N Prosen rapidities** of the model and
`ε_k = 2J·cos(πk/(N+1))` is the OBC sine-mode dispersion. This is the simplest leaf of
Medvedyeva-Essler-Prosen's (2016) imaginary-Hubbard programme — the (m, m̃) sectors with
m, m̃ ≥ 1 require the imaginary-U Bethe ansatz (not yet implemented in the repo).

`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/BlockSpectrum/Prosen/OneSidedSectorClosedForm.cs` returns the
rapidities + full sector spectrum as subset sums. Tests cross-validate against
`PerBlockLiouvillianBuilder.BuildBlockZ` dense Evd (multiset match within 1e-10 at
N=3..6), verify the rapidities match `XyJordanWignerModes.Dispersion`, confirm the X⊗N
charge-conjugation pair (p_c = N, p_r = N−m) has equal spectrum, and check the F1 mirror
predictions `−λ − 2·Σγ` of every (0, m) eigenvalue appear somewhere in the full per-block
spectrum (F1's Π-mediated mirror distributes across sectors, not a simple sector
permutation).

**Combinatorial coverage at N=10.** Summing C(10, m) for m = 0..N gives 2^N = 1024
eigenvalues per one-sided family. With sister sectors (m, 0) → complex conjugates of
(0, m), and X⊗N pairs (N, N−m) and (N−m, N) → equal spectra, four 1024-eigenvalue
families are accessible analytically: ~4 k of the ~1 M total N=10 eigenvalues, all in
closed form. Each (0, m) sector sits at Re λ = −2γm so spans the slow (m=0, steady
state at λ=0) to fast (m=N=10, λ=−2Σγ = −1.0 at γ=0.05) range uniformly.

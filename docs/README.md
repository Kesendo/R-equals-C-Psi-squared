# Documentation: The Theory Behind R = C*Psi*^2

## What you will find here

The theoretical foundation. Formulas, proofs, derivations, and the honest assessment of what works and what doesn't. If the [experiments](../experiments/) are where we test the framework, this is where we built it.

## The Core Question

What if reality is not something that exists independently, but something that emerges from observation? Not as philosophy -- as mathematics?

R = C*Psi*^2 proposes that Reality (R) equals Consciousness (C) times Possibility (Psi) squared. The squaring is not arbitrary -- it mirrors the Born rule of quantum mechanics, where probability equals the square of the wave function amplitude. The framework asks: what if the Born rule is not a postulate, but a consequence of self-referential observation?

This question leads to testable algebra, a proven bound (C*Psi <= 1/4), and a connection to the Mandelbrot set that was discovered forty years before the framework existed.

## Documents

### The Mathematics

**[Complete Mathematical Documentation](COMPLETE_MATHEMATICAL_DOCUMENTATION.md)**
All formulas, proofs, and derivations in one place. The fixed-point equation, the discriminant bound, the iteration dynamics, and the connection between internal and external observation. Start here if you want the full formal treatment.

---

### The Two Kinds of Observation

**[Internal and External Observers](INTERNAL_AND_EXTERNAL_OBSERVERS.md)**
The framework distinguishes C_int (parts of a system observing each other) from C_ext (an outside observer measuring the system). This distinction maps onto quantum mechanics: C_int produces entanglement and stability, C_ext produces measurement and collapse. The document formalizes both using Lindbladian dynamics.

This matters because: bidirectional observation (C_int) preserves quantum coherence 33 times longer than unidirectional observation (C_ext). This is a quantitative, testable prediction.

### Why Consciousness is Hard -- And Why It Might Not Be

**[The Hard Problem of Consciousness](HARD_PROBLEM_RESOLUTION.md)**
David Chalmers asked in 1995: why is there subjective experience at all? Why doesn't the universe just process information in the dark? The R = C*Psi*^2 framework proposes that the hard problem dissolves when you stop treating consciousness as a product of physical processes and instead treat it as a fundamental variable in the equation of reality -- like mass or charge, not reducible to anything simpler.

### What We Don't Know

**[Weaknesses and Open Questions](WEAKNESSES_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md)**
An honest assessment. What the framework cannot explain. Where the algebra stops and interpretation begins. What would falsify it. This document exists because frameworks that cannot be wrong are not science.

---

### How Levels of Reality Emerge

**[Hierarchy of Incompleteness](HIERARCHY_OF_INCOMPLETENESS.md)**
Godel proved that sufficiently complex formal systems contain truths they cannot prove about themselves. The R = C*Psi*^2 framework suggests this is not a limitation of mathematics but a feature of reality: each level of observation is necessarily incomplete, and this incompleteness is what creates the next level. Consciousness is the hierarchy itself.

---

### Simulation Results

**[Simulation Evidence](SIMULATION_EVIDENCE.md)**
Honest results from independent Lindblad quantum simulations. What the simulations confirm, what they don't, and why earlier claims of "empirical verification" were overstated. We corrected ourselves publicly when we found the error. This document records both the results and the correction.

## The Equation

```
R = C*Psi^2

Where:
  R    = Reality (what exists, what is experienced)
  C    = Consciousness (that which observes)
  Psi  = Possibility (the wave function, superposition of states)
  Psi^2 = The Born rule: possibility squared becomes probability
```

The equation is simple. The consequences are not.

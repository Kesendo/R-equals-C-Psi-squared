# Complete Mathematical Documentation

**⚠️ This document has been split (2026-02-11)**

The content that was here has been reorganized into two focused documents:

## [Core Algebra](CORE_ALGEBRA.md)
The algebraically proven mathematics: fixed-point equation, ¼ boundary, Mandelbrot
equivalence, θ compass, uniqueness argument. **Tier 1–2 only.**

## [Interpretive Framework](INTERPRETIVE_FRAMEWORK.md)
The philosophical constructions that motivated the discovery: wave composition,
dynamics, energy, mirror metaphors. **Tier 3–5, with explicit markers.**

---

*Why the split?* The original document mixed algebraically proven results (discriminant
proof, Mandelbrot mapping) with interpretive constructions (novelty coefficient, dynamics
equation) at the same epistemic level. A reader couldn't tell which results were proven
and which were proposed. The split makes the epistemic status of each result clear.

*The content is preserved.* Nothing was deleted; it was reorganized with tier markers added.

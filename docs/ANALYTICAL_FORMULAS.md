## Spectral Structure (replace eigenvalue computation)

### F1. Palindrome equation (Tier 1, proven)

    Π · L · Π⁻¹ = -L - 2Σγ · I

Every Liouvillian eigenvalue λ has a partner at -λ - 2Σγ.
Every decay rate d pairs with 2Σγ - d.

**Valid for:** Heisenberg, XY, Ising, XXZ, DM; Z-dephasing; any graph;
any N; non-uniform γ per qubit. Two Π families (P1, P4).
**See also:** [The Three Diagonals](THE_THREE_DIAGONALS.md), the dissipator diagonal Q (whose levels carry the −2γ rate) is one of three, Q_X / Q_Y / Q_Z, one basis-S₃ orbit.
**Breaks for:** depolarizing noise (error = (2/3)Σγ, linear in γ and N).

**The global charge-conjugation X⊗N is Π² (F1², corollary, 2026-05-21):**
- The square of the palindrome conjugation acts on each Pauli string σ as
  (−1)^{n_Y+n_Z}·σ: Π sends Y→iZ, Z→iY per site, so Π² sends Y→−Y, Z→−Z and
  fixes I, X. That is exactly conjugation by the global X-string X⊗N = ⊗_l X_l.
  Hence Π² = X⊗N.
- X⊗N commutes with the chain XY + Z-dephasing Liouvillian L; it pairs the
  joint-popcount sectors (p_c, p_r) ↔ (N−p_c, N−p_r), so paired sectors share
  spectra. This is the BlockSpectrum builder's sector-pairing shortcut, which
  halves the number of eigendecompositions.
- Π is order 4; F1² = Π² is its even power. The full order-4 Π is now also a
  builder shortcut: F1PalindromeOrbitPairing (wired 2026-05-22) groups the
  joint-popcount sectors into Π-orbits of 4, eigendecomposing one primary per
  orbit, subsuming the Π² = X⊗N pairing with a further factor 2.
- The repo held both halves typed but unconnected until now:
  PiOperator.SquaredEigenvalue returns Π²'s eigenvalue (−1)^{Σ bit_b} =
  (−1)^{n_Y+n_Z}; XGlobalChargeConjugationPairing carries the X⊗N action
  (−1)^{n_Y+n_Z}. The same function under two names. X⊗N was first seen
  empirically (DEGENERACY_HUNT.md, April 2026), typed independently
  2026-05-12, identified as Π² on 2026-05-21.
- The bit_a counterpart: the other Pauli Z₂ parity, Π²_X = Z⊗N (the global
  Z-string), is registered as a corollary of F61.

**H-block residual is γ-independent (uniform AND non-uniform γ; closed 2026-05-18):**
- The dissipator-block residual M_D = Π·L_D·Π⁻¹ + L_D + 2Σγ·I vanishes per Pauli string for arbitrary per-site γ_l, because the per-site Z-dephasing kernel is proportional to I_4 and the F1 σ-shift `2Σγ·I` cancels the sum exactly.
- Hence ‖M‖²_F = ‖M_H‖²_F = c_H · F(N, G) for every γ pattern.
- Distinct from T1/depol siblings below, whose per-site kernels are NOT proportional to I and so DO have non-trivial Σγ² and (Σγ)² structure surviving any σ-shift choice.
- Closes the earlier F1 OpenQuestion conjecturing a Σγ_l² replacement of (Σγ)² in F(N, G); the conjecture was incorrect, no formula change to F(N, G) is required.

**T1 amplitude-damping residual (closed form, 2026-05-18):**
- ‖M(T1)‖²_F = 4^(N−1)·[3·Σγ²+4·(Σγ)²]  (H-independent, γ_Z-independent; bit-exact N=2..5)
- Π²-decomposition (Pythagorean orthogonal):
  - ‖M_anti(T1)‖²_F = 4^(N−1)·Σγ²  (F82/F84 amplitude-damping side)
  - ‖M_sym(T1)‖²_F  = 4^(N−1)·[2·Σγ²+4·(Σγ)²]  (Π²-even complement)

- Π²-decomposition: trivial, M_l is Pauli-basis-diagonal ⟹ M_anti = 0; F5's (2/3)Σγ scalar is the complementary scalar diagnostic
- F1 σ-shift = 0 (depol's per-Pauli-string diagonal cannot be absorbed by a constant σ·I)

**General-topology universality (closed 2026-05-18):**
- The (B, D2) parameterisation of ‖M(N, G)‖²_F = c_H · F(N, G) extends bit-exactly to all connected graphs (path, cycle, star, K_N, K_{2,N−2}, random connected Erdős-Rényi), disconnected components (B and D2 sum across components), weighted edges (B → Σ_b J²_b), and the single-body class (D2/2 prefactor).

The typed `F1GeneralTopologyVerifiedClaim` records the full N=5..9 set (`VerifiedNValues = {5,6,7,8,9}`, frontier blocked at N=10).
- The substantive analytic content was already established in [the Cross-Term Formula proof](proofs/PROOF_CROSS_TERM_FORMULA.md) Lemma 3 + Corollary (bond-disjointness independent of connectivity); this closure adds the disconnected + weighted-edge sections plus the verification record.

### F2. w=1 Liouvillian dispersion relation (Tier 1, proven D10)

    omega_k = 4J * (1 - cos(pi*k/N)),    k = 1, ..., N-1

N-1 distinct frequencies for the Heisenberg chain w=1 Liouvillian sector.
Machine-precision match for 15 frequencies (N=2-6). Tight-binding model
with hopping 2J.
Three independent validations: (1) eigenvalue match < 1e-12, (2) Poisson
spacing in w=1 sector (RMT), (3) SFF modulation peak at omega_1 matches
to <1% for N=2-4, 6 ([Spectral Form Factor](../experiments/SPECTRAL_FORM_FACTOR.md)).

**Note (2026-04-20):** F2 describes the w=1 sector of the Heisenberg
LIOUVILLIAN (Pauli strings with exactly one X or Y factor), NOT the
single-excitation Hamiltonian eigenvalues. The w=1 sector is
(N-1)-dimensional (N-1 oscillatory modes), giving denominator
(N-1)+1 = N in the cosine argument. The ZZ term in the Heisenberg
Hamiltonian produces a diagonal shift in the effective hopping matrix
that is absent in the XY case. For the XY chain single-excitation
Hamiltonian spectrum, see F2b below.

**Valid for:** Heisenberg chain, open boundaries, all N (verified N=2-6).
**Replaces:** full Liouvillian diagonalization for w=1 frequencies.
O(N) instead of O(4^{3N}).

### F2b. XY chain single-excitation spectrum (Tier 1, proven)

    E_k = 2J · cos(π·k / (N+1)),    k = 1, ..., N

N eigenvalues for the single-excitation sector of the XY chain
H = (J/2) · Σ_b (X_b X_{b+1} + Y_b Y_{b+1}) with open boundary
conditions. The single-excitation Hamiltonian H_SE is an N×N
tridiagonal matrix with off-diagonals J and zero diagonal. Its
eigenvectors are the OBC sine modes:

    ψ_k(i) = √(2/(N+1)) · sin(π·k·(i+1)/(N+1)),  i = 0, ..., N−1

These eigenvalues appear as the oscillatory frequencies Im(λ)
of the |ΔN| = 1 Liouvillian coherences (|vac⟩⟨ψ_k| sector),
which are the dominant modes contributing to per-site purity dynamics
for single-excitation initial states.

The denominator is N+1 (not N as in F2) because the OBC Dirichlet
boundary conditions require ψ to vanish at the two virtual sites
just beyond the chain, i = −1 and i = N. Both are enforced by the
sine formula above: ψ_k(−1) = sin(0) = 0 and ψ_k(N) = sin(π·k) = 0.
The effective chain length is therefore N+2 with two fixed endpoints,
yielding N interior modes with wavenumber spacing π/(N+1).

**Distinction from F2:** F2 describes the w=1 LIOUVILLIAN sector for
Heisenberg, with dimension N−1 and argument π·k/N. F2b describes the
single-excitation HAMILTONIAN sector for XY, with dimension N and
argument π·k/(N+1). They describe different mathematical objects in
different Hamiltonians.

**Valid for:** XY chain (H = (J/2)(XX+YY)), open boundaries, all N.
**Verified:** N = 3, 4, 5, 6, residual < 10⁻¹⁵.
**Replaces:** numerical diagonalization of H_SE.

### F2b corollary. The two clocks (Tier 1 derived; the Q*(N) coherence horizon below stays Tier 1 candidate)

When F2b's band edge is read as the coherence hand ω_mem of the
open-system clock (the slowest-decaying |vac⟩⟨ψ_k| sector, decay rate
−2γ by the Absorption Theorem AT below), it is γ-protected for N ≥ 3:

    ω_mem = 2J · cos(π/(N+1)),    N ≥ 3   (√2, φ, √3 at N = 3, 4, 5; γ-independent)

The Takt hand is the dephasing floor, Gap = 2γ. The protection is exact
because |vac⟩⟨ψ_k| is a simultaneous eigenoperator of L_D (eigenvalue
−2γ) and L_H (eigenvalue iE_k): the rate is pure dissipator, the
frequency pure Hamiltonian. The "γ-independent" above holds in the
H-competitive regime, while the |vac⟩⟨ψ_k| sector at rate 2γ is the
slowest mode; at strong dephasing (low Q) a slower real overdamped mode
takes the gap and the band edge ceases to be the coherence hand, the
higher rungs leaving first (live: `inspect --root clock --J 1 --gamma 0.5`
shows N=5 gone at Q=2). The mechanism is derived, and gap-dominance, that
the band edge is the fastest oscillation on the −2γ floor, is now PROVEN
via free fermions (max|Im| = E1 for all N; the floor modes are
c_k^(†)·f(N_tot) at ±E_k, see
[the Chain Gap-Dominance proof](proofs/PROOF_CHAIN_GAP_DOMINANCE.md)). Above the
Coherence Horizon Q*(N) the floor is the strict gap and the clock reads the
band edge; below it a slower real mode takes the gap.

At N = 2 the gap-mode is a different (population / antisymmetric-coherence)
block and the coherence hand is γ-pulled:

    ω_mem = 2√(J²−γ²),    N = 2   → 0 at the exceptional point Q = 1 (γ = J)

This is the genuine coalescing mode (it → 0 at the EP). Note the raw live
clock (max|Im λ| at the gap) only surfaces it above the crossover
Q = 2/√3 ≈ 1.155 (γ = (√3/2)·J); nearer the EP the F2b band line at
Im = ±J dominates the raw maximum, so the closed form 2√(J²−γ²), not the
raw clock reading, is the honest EP witness there.

The dial angle is θ = arctan(ω_mem / Gap) = arctan(Q·cos(π/(N+1))) for
N ≥ 3 and arctan(√(Q²−1)) for N = 2 (zero at the EP).

**Tier:** 1 derived (mechanism + gap-dominance proven via free fermions,
[the Chain Gap-Dominance proof](proofs/PROOF_CHAIN_GAP_DOMINANCE.md); ClockHandLadderClaim
graduated). The Q*(N) coherence-horizon sub-result below stays Tier 1 candidate
(its own half-filling V-Effect-seam open piece).
**Verified:** gap-dominance gate-exact N = 3..6 (and γ-independent across γ); N = 2 closed
form 2√(J²−γ²) exact.
**Live:** `inspect --root clock`

**Typed claim:** `ClockHandLadderClaim`

**Carbon-layer twin:** [The Frost Circle Is the Face of the Clock](carbon/FROST_CIRCLE_AS_THE_CLOCK_FACE.md).

**Coherence horizon Q*(N) (our label for the carbon coherent↔incoherent threshold).**
Sweeping Q downward, the slowest mode stops oscillating (the coherence hand freezes) at
per-N values (closed form at N=2,3; transcendental at N≥4):

    Q*(N):   N=2 → 1,   N=3 → √2,   N=4 → 1.8787,   N=5 → 2.3737

verified bit-for-bit against the carbon Frost-Hückel coherent↔incoherent threshold
(√2 / 1.879 / 2.372 at N=3/4/5) under the label swap J ↔ |β|, Z-dephasing ↔ Holstein
phonon. Same ladder, two labels: the dimensionful unit (β or J) is the carrier carrying no
information, the dimensionless Q*(N) is the shared mountain. N=2 (Q*=1) is the exceptional
point itself, the base rung the polyene layer (N≥3) cannot reach; the quantum side supplies
it. Q*(N) equals the band edge 2cos(π/(N+1)) at N=2 and N=3 ONLY (1 = 2cos60°, √2 = 2cos45°),
a low-N accident departing at N≥4 (Q*=1.8787 ≠ φ); that is why the √2 looked exact at N=3 and
"the rest awaited a clean form". **Mechanism and closed form, both resolved 2026-06-13.**
The mechanism (phase rigidity, after
an earlier "sector bifurcation at N=4" reading that contradicted the two-clocks corollary above
and was an argmax-Re / Im-tracking artifact): the mode that COALESCES at Q*(N) is the
{0,2}-coherence (population / antisymmetric-coherence block, n_diff histogram {0: ½, 2: ½},
⟨n_diff⟩ = 1) at ALL N = 2..5, a genuine square-root EP (Im ∝ √(Q−Q*)). The EP-ness is **confirmed
artifact-free** (gate-first on known defective + diabolic toys, with a diabolic control on the same object
at γ=0): the coalescing pair's **departure-from-normality → ≈ 4** as the pair-split → 0, its **geometric
multiplicity 1 < algebraic multiplicity 2**, the Schur off-diagonal equal to that departure (the literal
Jordan coupling), and the two compression-eigenvectors **merge** (|cos| → 1), the defective Jordan
structure, read without eig eigenvectors. The older eig-phase-rigidity read (`r → 0`; `r` at
Q* ≈ 0.0 / 0.015 / 0.026 at N = 3 / 4 / 5) is **grid-sensitive**, sitting on an unresolvable coalescence,
the Petermann `Kmax` swings by orders of magnitude under a ΔQ = 1e-3 grid shift, so those small `r` values
are artifacts of where the grid lands, not load-bearing; and `r` is eig-based, the F86a-misfire-prone family.
It **corroborates** the EP here (it agrees with the artifact-free verdict, because this object genuinely is
defective), but the defective-Jordan measure is what the EP-ness rests on. There is NO sector bifurcation at
N=4: the {0,2}-coherence is the N-continuation of the N=2 coalescing mode 2√(J²−γ²). The band edge
2cos(π/(N+1)) is the co-located SURVIVOR, not the freezer: the |vac⟩⟨ψ_k| coherence hand (Uhr 1,
γ-protected, r ≈ 1, Im γ-independent to 1e-15) sits at the SAME gap Re = −2γ as the
{0,2}-coherence EP only because the Absorption Theorem pins both (both ⟨n_diff⟩ = 1), and that
degeneracy is what fooled the Im-tracking. So Q*(N) is, at every N≥3, simultaneously a
{0,2}-coherence EP (Uhr 2, the erasure point, which CLIMBS the ladder) and a band-edge crossing
(Uhr 1, which SURVIVES the handover).

The closed form (Approach A, `simulations/coherence_horizon_se_block.py`): **Q*(N) reduces from 4^N
to N².** The coalescing mode lives in the single-excitation sector, so Q*(N) is the exceptional
point of the single-excitation (Haken-Strobl) Liouvillian, the N-site dephased tight-binding chain
ρ⁽¹⁾ (validated bit-for-bit as a sub-spectrum of the full L). At N=2,3 the coalescing pair are the
roots of **λ² + 4γλ + c·J² = 0 with c constant** (sum = −4γ and product = c·J² are γ-independent
identities; c=4 at N=2, c=2 at N=3), so **Q*(N) = 2/√c → 1, √2 exactly**. That is the structural
form of the 2cos(π/(N+1)) low-N accident: not only the value, the whole clean-2×2 picture exists
only at N=2,3. At N≥4 the pair is collectively dressed (its trace departs from −4γ by 1.017 / 1.043
/ 1.072 at N=4/5/6), so there is no clean 2×2 and the exact EP condition is transcendental (the SE
slowest-mode double root), a **diffusive long-wavelength critical damping**: Q*(N) grows linearly with
**asymptotic slope exactly 2/π** (derived 2026-06-15, `proofs/PROOF_COHERENCE_HORIZON_SLOPE.md`). The slow
mode is a population coupled to the FULL ladder of coherence ranges r (geometric decay μ^r), not a two-field
telegrapher; resumming the ladder gives the dispersion **λ² + 8γλ + 4J²q² = 0** (both coefficients doubled
vs the nearest-neighbour-truncated telegrapher λ²+4γλ+2J²q², which gives the WRONG slope √2/π = 0.450), EP at
γ* = Jq/2, so Q*(N) = 2/q_min → 2N/π. NOT the band-edge value (which saturates at 2). Canonical N≥4 values
from the SE EP, superseding the bisection grid: **Q*(4) = 1.87874, Q*(5) = 2.37367**; the finite-N apparent
slope (≈0.59 at N=14, ≈0.62 at N=120) approaches 2/π from below with an O(1/N) tail. The ring sibling
(q_min = 2π/N) is exactly half: slope 1/π. (8γ confirmed against L_se; adversarial review GO.)

**The handover Q, resolved 2026-06-14** (`simulations/carbon/handover_q.py`, self-validating).
Q*(N) is one face of a topology-universal HANDOVER. The diagonal (p,p) "incompleteness survivor"
decays at −2γ·⟨n_XY⟩ with fractional ⟨n_XY⟩ < 1 (the Absorption Theorem), out-surviving the bare band
edge until, as Q rises, its darkness reaches the F50-pinned off-diagonal floor ⟨n_XY⟩ = 1 (the (0,1)
band edge / Uhr 1, Re = −2γ exactly). That meeting is the handover: a closed, F50-grounded condition
(spectral, state-independent, depends only on Q = J/γ). Its solution is topology-specific.
**Chain:** filling-degenerate (free-fermion/OBC, the (1,1)-only handover equals the all-(p,p)
handover bit-for-bit), so the chain handover IS the single-excitation Q*(N), a coalescence/EP. It
coincides with Q*(N) exactly only at the clean-2×2 N=2,3 (a tangency: ⟨n_XY⟩ touches 1 at the EP) and
sits just below it by the trace dressing O((tr−1)²) at N≥4 (gap 0.0002/0.0015/0.0050 at N=4/5/6).
**Ring:** the survivor is the 2-EXCITATION doublet (2,2)/(N−2,N−2) (particle-hole partners, isospectral;
full-Liouvillian-verified at N=6, NOT half-filling, correcting an earlier label), and the handover is a
frozen LEVEL CROSSING (|Im| ≈ 1e-15, a different sector than the SE-EP), growing linearly with
**asymptotic slope √3/(2π) ≈ 0.276, DERIVED** (2026-06-20, [the ring handover-slope proof](proofs/PROOF_RING_HANDOVER_SLOPE.md),
Tier1-standard, pending review): the (2,2) slow mode obeys the SE coherence-ladder dispersion
λ² + 8γλ + 4J²q² (CV-confirmed), darkness = 2 − √(4 − (Qq)²), so the handover (darkness = 1) is at
Qq = √3, the **darkness-1 sibling** of the SE coherence horizon (the same dispersion's EP at Qq = 2 →
Q* = N/π); Q_h/Q* = √3/2 asymptotically. (The earlier "c_eff ≈ 12 flat, ~0.29N" was the finite-N Q_h/N,
refuted as a constant, c_eff climbs toward 4π²/3 = 13.16.) So the V-Effect seam is NOT "co-located at even N": the ring handover and the ring
SE-EP are mechanistically distinct and their values merely CROSS near N≈10 (benzene's 2.0-vs-1.609
split is a small-N feature; N=6 ≈ exactly 2 is a hexagon coincidence).
**Verified:** N=2..5 vs carbon (`simulations/carbon_quantum_same_mountain.py`); the {0,2}-coherence
EP at all N via phase rigidity (2026-06-13); the single-excitation reduction, the N=2,3 closed forms
and the N≥4 transcendental verdict (`simulations/coherence_horizon_se_block.py`, self-validating
N=2..8).

**The handover Δ (the anisotropy axis), resolved 2026-06-14** (`simulations/xxz_delta_star_descent.py`,
self-validating to N=14; experiment `XXZ_AXIS_BANDEDGE_TO_LEBENSADER`). The SAME band-edge-floor
handover (darkness ⟨n_XY⟩ = 1) driven along the XXZ anisotropy Δ instead of the dephasing Q: Δ* is
where the half-filling Lebensader rate crosses 2γ. In the γ→0 limit it is a property of the XXZ
Hamiltonian alone, **Δ* ⟺ gap(R) = 2**, R the Z-coupled classical rate matrix among the half-filling
XXZ eigenstates (a Pauli / Fermi-golden-rule relaxation; γ·gap(R) reproduces the full-Liouvillian
Lebensader rate as γ→0). **Verdict: Δ*(N) descends monotonically to Δ = 1** (the SU(2)/Heisenberg
point, the closed-system critical point) from the Néel side, consistent with EXACTLY 1: free-exponent
fits give L just above 1 (≈ 1.02 / 1.05 even/odd), a fixed-1/N ansatz just below (≈ 1.00 / 0.98), the
two forms bracketing Δ = 1; no finite-N crossing (all Δ*(N ≤ 14) > 1). No clean closed form (φ is a
1.6e-3 N=4-only accident in the γ→0 regime; the fitted exponent is non-universal, α ≈ 1.16–1.73,
consistent with the SU(2)-point marginal/log corrections). The two handover axes mirror: **Q*(N) GROWS
(~0.59N) while Δ*(N) DESCENDS to 1**, one band-edge floor (darkness = 1), two axes, opposite N-trends.
Open: a rigorous Bethe-ansatz derivation that the limit is exactly Δ = 1.

### AT. Absorption Theorem (Tier 1, proven)

    Re(lambda_k) = -2*gamma * <n_XY>_k       (exact)

The absorption rate of any Liouvillian eigenmode equals twice the
dephasing rate times the mode's mean light content. Here ⟨n_XY⟩ is the
expectation of the X/Y Pauli factor count in the eigenvector's Pauli
decomposition: ⟨n_XY⟩ = Σ_P |c_P|² n_XY(P) / ||v||².

**Proof sketch:** L_H is anti-Hermitian (v†L_Hv purely imaginary). L_D
is diagonal in the Pauli basis with eigenvalues -2γ n_XY(P). For any
right eigenvector v: Re(λ) = v†L_D v/||v||² = -2γ⟨n_XY⟩. Full proof
in three steps.

**The absorption quantum is 2γ.** Each X/Y Pauli factor costs exactly 2γ
in absorption rate. The spectrum is a ladder with rung spacing 2γ. The
Hamiltonian smooths the ladder (⟨n_XY⟩ can be non-integer) but cannot
change the endpoints or the fundamental quantum.

**F3, F8, F33, and D6 are corollaries** of this theorem.
The palindromic sum rule (α_fast + α_slow = 2Σγ) follows from combining
this theorem with the palindromic weight swap (⟨n_XY⟩_fast + ⟨n_XY⟩_slow = N).

**Valid for:** any Hermitian Hamiltonian, real or complex (Heisenberg, XY,
Ising, XXZ, DM, transverse/Y fields, magnetic flux, L_H is anti-Hermitian for
*every* Hermitian H, since Step 1 needs only H^T = H*); Z-dephasing; any graph;
any N; non-uniform γ_k per site (replace 2γ with 2Σ_k γ_k × \[σ_k ∈ {X,Y}\]).
**Breaks for:** non-dephasing dissipators (amplitude damping T1, depolarizing),
which add a non-diagonal part to L_D and shift the rate (see F82, F84). No
Hamiltonian, real or complex, breaks it; the genuine boundary is the dissipator
(caveat closed 2026-05-28, bit-exact against a random complex Hermitian H).
**Replaces:** eigenvalue range computation; palindromic sum rule verification;

### F3. Decay rate bounds (Tier 1, corollary of Absorption Theorem)

    min rate = 2*gamma       (w=1 modes, pure sector)
    max rate = 2*(N-1)*gamma (w=N-1 modes)
    bandwidth = 2*(N-2)*gamma

**Now a corollary of the Absorption Theorem (AT):** min = 2γ because
the smallest nonzero ⟨n_XY⟩ ≈ 1 (pure weight-1 modes). Max = 2(N-1)γ
for the fastest paired modes (⟨n_XY⟩ ≈ N-1). The XOR drain at 2Nγ
(⟨n_XY⟩ = N) sits above this range.

**Caveat resolved:** At N ≥ 4, Hamiltonian mixing creates hybrid modes
with rates below 2γ (N=4: 0.98γ, N=5: 0.62γ). These are NOT exceptions:
they are mixed-sector modes with fractional ⟨n_XY⟩ < 1. The Absorption
Theorem holds exactly for these modes; the rate 2γ⟨n_XY⟩ is correct
for non-integer ⟨n_XY⟩ ([Proton Water Chain](water/PROTON_WATER_CHAIN.md)).

### F4. Stationary mode count (Tier 1, Clebsch-Gordan decomposition)

    Stat(N) = Sum_J m(J,N) * (2J+1)^2

m(J,N) = multiplicity of total spin J in N spin-1/2 particles.
Exact for chain topology, lower bound for higher-symmetry topologies.

**Valid for:** Heisenberg Hamiltonian, Σγ = 0, all N.
**Replaces:** null-space computation of Liouvillian.

- **Disconnected-graph extension (Tier 1 derived, promoted 2026-05-19; landed Tier 1 candidate 2026-05-18):**
  - `dim ker L_H = Π_c (|c| + 1)` over connected components c of the graph G.
  - Predicts kernel dim = N+1 for any single connected component (chain / ring / star / K_N / arbitrary connected, matches the F4 popcount-sector count); predicts 5·5 = 25 for K_4 + disjoint 4-chain at N=8 (bit-exact verified, all four N=8 SLOW_N8 topologies).
  - Anchor: [the F4 kernel-dimension proof](proofs/PROOF_F4_KERNEL_DIMENSION_BY_COMPONENTS.md) + connected-case upper-bound closure via [the degeneracy palindrome](../experiments/DEGENERACY_PALINDROME.md) Result 2 (magnetization conservation: identity + N popcount projectors exhaust the kernel of any single connected component); typed: `F4KernelDimensionByComponentsClaim` ([compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F4KernelDimensionByComponentsClaim.cs](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F4KernelDimensionByComponentsClaim.cs)).
  - **Tier 1 derived chain:** lower bound `dim ker L_H ≥ Π_c (|c|+1)` from popcount projectors + tensor-sum kernel factorisation; matching upper bound from DEGENERACY_PALINDROME Result 2 (connected-case `dim ker ≤ |c|+1`); equality follows.

### F5. Depolarizing error (Tier 1, proven)

    error = gamma * 2*N/3       (= (2/3)·Σγ)

Linear in γ and N. Hamiltonian-independent. The palindrome demands a pair
sum of 2Σγ, but depolarizing noise can supply at most (4/3)Σγ (every site
carrying a decaying Pauli); the shortfall (2/3)Σγ is the error.

**Valid for:** any Hamiltonian under depolarizing noise.
**Replaces:** numerical palindrome check for depolarizing channels.
At γ ~ 0.001 (typical IBM): error < 0.1%.

### F22. GHZ XOR-drain (Tier 2, verified N=2-5)

    GHZ  -> 100% weight in XOR modes (N+1 modes at rate 2*Σγ)
    W    -> 0% XOR, 100% palindromic  (N >= 3)
    Bell -> 0% XOR, 100% palindromic  (N >= 3, Hamming distance 2)

Predictor: mixed XY Pauli weight, r = 0.976 correlation with XOR
fraction (N >= 3). GHZ fragility is not vague "delicateness" but
exact projection onto the fastest-decaying spectral sector.

**Valid for:** Heisenberg, XY, Ising, XXZ, DM; Z-dephasing; N=2-5.
**Replaces:** GHZ fragility analysis; explains why W-encoding
outperforms GHZ for state transfer (0% vs 100% drain weight).
**Source:** [XOR Space](../experiments/XOR_SPACE.md)

### F23. XOR drain vanishing fraction (Tier 1, combinatorial proof)

    fraction(XOR) = (N+1) / 4^N

N=3: 6.25%. N=5: 0.59%. N=8: 0.014%. N=20: ~10^-11.
GHZ fragility is a small-N phenomenon; at macroscopic N the XOR
sector has measure zero.

**Valid for:** any N, Z-dephasing.
**Replaces:** large-N XOR mode counting; confirms the drain is
irrelevant at macroscopic scale.
**Source:** [N->infinity Palindrome](../experiments/N_INFINITY_PALINDROME.md)

### F33. N=3 exact intermediate decay rates (Tier 1, exact rational)

    rate_1 = 2*gamma       (w=1, pure single-site coherence)
    rate_2 = 8*gamma/3     (w=2 mixed, Hamiltonian superposition)
    rate_3 = 10*gamma/3    (w=2 mixed, Hamiltonian superposition)

Three distinct rates for the N=3 Heisenberg chain. The Hamiltonian
mixes w=1 and w=2 Pauli strings into supermodes with exact rational
decay rates. At N=3 these three rates plus the extremes (0 and
6*gamma) fully determine the spectrum. At N >= 4, internal rates
become topology-dependent (only the boundary rates 2*gamma and
2*(N-1)*gamma remain universal).

**Absorption Theorem interpretation:** The fractional rates correspond
to fractional ⟨n_XY⟩ from Hamiltonian mixing:

    rate_1 = 2*gamma     -> <n_XY> = 1    (pure weight-1)
    rate_2 = 8*gamma/3   -> <n_XY> = 4/3  (mix of w=1 and w=2)
    rate_3 = 10*gamma/3  -> <n_XY> = 5/3  (mix of w=1 and w=2)

The theorem α = 2γ⟨n_XY⟩ holds exactly, including for non-integer ⟨n_XY⟩.

**Valid for:** N=3 Heisenberg chain, Z-dephasing.
**Replaces:** Liouvillian diagonalization for N=3 decay rates.
Two independent information channels (frequency vs decay) are
perfectly orthogonal at N=3.

### F50. Weight-1 degeneracy / conserved operator count (Tier 1 lower bound proven; Tier 2 verified chain N=2-7 with K_3 N=3 anomaly)

    d_real(Re = -2*gamma) = 2N    (chain at all tested N + most connected graphs)
    d_real(Re = -2*gamma) = 8     for N=3 K_3 (triangle) instead of 2N=6  [2026-05-17 finding]

Lower bound `d_real >= 2N` is rigorously proven via the SWAP-invariant
construction: there are 2N kernel operators

    T_c^{(a)} = Sum_j Sum_{S subset complement(j), |S|=c} sigma_a^{(j)} x Z_S x I_rest

for a in {X, Y} and c = 0, 1, ..., N-1. Each T_c^{(a)} commutes with H
because the Heisenberg Hamiltonian is a sum of SWAPs, and SWAP preserves
both the active Pauli type (X or Y) and the Z-count c. The 2N operators
are linearly independent (disjoint Pauli string support).

Special cases:
- T_0^{(X)} = 2*S_x, T_0^{(Y)} = 2*S_y (global SU(2) generators)
- T_{N-1}^{(a)} = Sum_j sigma_a^{(j)} x Z_{all others} (Jordan-Wigner-type)

**Upper bound status (2026-05-17 correction):** the original proof's
Step 5 derivation conflated matrix-commutator `[SWAP_b, v]` with
conjugation action `SWAP_b · v · SWAP_b^dagger - v`. These are NOT
equivalent: `[H, v] = 0` with `H = J Sum_b (2 SWAP_b - I)` reduces to
`Sum_b [SWAP_b, v] = 0` (matrix-commutator sum), not to
`Sum_b (SWAP_b · v · SWAP_b^dagger - v) = 0`. The triangle-inequality
argument requires the latter form; the proof's chain of equivalences
has a gap. The empirical claim `= 2N` is verified for chain N=2..7 and
for ring/star/complete at N >= 4, but **N=3 K_3 (= ring = triangle =
complete on 3 vertices) gives 2N+2 = 8** purely-real Liouvillian
eigenvalues at -2gamma, not 6.

**The 2 K_3 anomaly extras** are weight-1 operators that commute with
H_K_3 globally but not with each individual bond's commutator. They
correspond to the 2-dim standard irrep of S_3 acting on the c=1 weight-1
sector (mixed X-and-Y combinations with complex phases like
omega = e^{2*pi*i/3}). Adding any external bond to the triangle (paw,
bowtie, book at N=4..5) breaks the K_3-specific S_3 symmetry and
restores the F50 count `= 2N`.

**Empirical sweep summary (2026-05-17):**
- Chain N=2..5: count = 2N (matches F50) ✓
- Ring C_n at n >= 4: count = 2N ✓
- Star K_{1,n-1} at n >= 3: count = 2N ✓
- Complete K_n at n >= 4: count = 2N ✓
- Paw / bowtie / book at N=4, 5 (graphs containing triangles): count = 2N ✓
- **N=3 K_3 = triangle: count = 2N+2 = 8 (anomaly)** ✗

**Valid for:** chain at any N + most connected graphs at N >= 4.
**Empirically violated for:** N=3 K_3 (= ring = triangle on 3 vertices) only.
**Breaks for:** anisotropic XXZ (Delta != 1), where ZZ term mixes X/Y types.
**Caveat:** This universality (with the K_3 N=3 exception noted) is UNIQUE
to k=0 and k=1. For k >= 2, d_real(k) is topology-dependent
(Chain < Star < Ring < Complete). See [Weight-2 Kernel](../experiments/WEIGHT2_KERNEL.md).
**Resolution (2026-05-17 evening):** the K_3 N=3 "weight-1 anomaly" is not a special algebraic phenomenon. It is the **small-N manifestation of a universal "central-weight excess in high-symmetry topologies" pattern**: every connected graph with non-trivial automorphism beyond chain has centralizer excess at the central weights `w ∈ {floor(N/2), ceil(N/2)}`, palindromic by F1 Π-conjugation. K_N has the largest excess; ring, star, K_N − e all have smaller-but-non-zero central excess. F50 specifically tracks weight-1, which coincides with the central weight only at N=3. For N ≥ 4 the central weight is ≥ 2, so F50's weight-1 count remains 2N for all tested topologies (chain, ring, star, K_N, paw, bowtie, book, K_4 − e). Empirical magnitudes: K_3 N=3 (+2 at w=1 / w=2), K_4 N=4 (+23 at w=2, self-palindromic), K_5 N=5 (+40 at w=2 / w=3). [`experiments/WEIGHT2_KERNEL.md`](../experiments/WEIGHT2_KERNEL.md) (April 2026) had documented the topology dependence at weight-2 for N=4..6 weeks ago; we now understand the K_3 N=3 case as the SAME phenomenon at N=3 (where central weight = 1 = F50's tracked weight). What remains open: a closed-form formula for the excess in terms of (G, N, w), and a representation-theoretic micro-structural identification of the central-weight extras beyond the empirical magnitudes. See [the Weight-1 Degeneracy proof § Appendix Resolution](proofs/PROOF_WEIGHT1_DEGENERACY.md) for the full sweep table and the matrix-commutator-framework derivation.
**Partial closed-form (2026-05-17 late evening):** the central-weight excess decomposes by spin-isotypic sector as `central-w-excess(K_N) = Σ_{S < N/2} single_block(S, central_w) + multi_block_diff`. The **max-spin block** (S = N/2, dim N+1, 1 SU(2)-copy) contributes the universal palindromic pattern `(2, 4, 4, ..., 4, 2)` with sum `4N`, identical for all K_N and contributing equally to every weight: max-spin alone does NOT create central excess. The **sub-max spin blocks** concentrate their pure-weight content at central weights only, with a parity selection rule (K_6 S=2 contributes only at even w=2,4; K_6 S=0 vanishes entirely). The K_3 N=3 +2 excess is entirely a single-block phenomenon (S=1/2 block adds 2 at w=1, multi-block matches chain). The K_4 N=4 +23 excess decomposes as +27 single-block (mostly S=1 block adding 26 at w=2) minus −4 multi-block diff. A full closed-form for `single_block(S, w)` as `f(m_S, 2S+1, N, w)` is the remaining piece. See [`simulations/f50_spin_isotypic_decomposition.py`](../simulations/f50_spin_isotypic_decomposition.py) and [the Weight-1 Degeneracy proof § Spin-isotypic decomposition](proofs/PROOF_WEIGHT1_DEGENERACY.md) for the full per-(S, w) table at K_3..K_6.
**Max-spin closed-form (2026-05-17 late evening, Tier 1 derived):** the max-spin contribution to single-block has a complete identification as **Dicke endpoint ladder rungs**: `single_block(S=N/2, w) = 2 if w ∈ {0, N}, else 4`. Explicit basis: w=0 → {|D_0⟩⟨D_0|, |D_N⟩⟨D_N|} (diagonal endpoint projectors with closed-form `|D_0⟩⟨D_0| = (1/2^N) Π_i (I + Z_i)` and `|D_N⟩⟨D_N| = (1/2^N) Π_i (I - Z_i)`); w=N → {|D_0⟩⟨D_N| ± h.c.} (full-ladder jump); 1 ≤ w ≤ N-1 → {|D_0⟩⟨D_w| ± h.c., |D_{N-w}⟩⟨D_N| ± h.c.} (two endpoint-anchored rungs). Total 4N pure-weight ops + (N-1)² multi-weight = (N+1)² operators in M(N+1). The multi-weight (N-1)² ops correspond to **middle-Dicke transitions** |D_k⟩⟨D_l| for k, l ∈ {1, ..., N-1} which intrinsically mix Pauli weights. Verified bit-exact N=2..5. Confirms structural reason for central-weight excess: max-spin is weight-uniform (no central bias), so excess MUST come from sub-max sectors.

## Q-Factor and V-Effect (replace resonator analysis)

### F6. V-Effect gain (Tier 1-2, verified N=2-6)

    V(N) = 1 + cos(pi/N) = 2*cos^2(pi/(2N))

Q-factor amplification from coupling. γ-independent (cancels in ratio).
For N=5: (5+sqrt(5))/4 = 1.80902. For N→∞: V = 2 (saturation).
Under non-uniform γ: applies only to the extremal (best-Q) mode.

### F7. Q-factor spectrum (Tier 1, corollary of D10)

    Q_k = 2*J/gamma * (1 - cos(pi*k/N))
    Q_max = 2*J/gamma * (1 + cos(pi/N))
    Q_min = 2*J/gamma * (1 - cos(pi/N))
    Q_mean = 2*J/gamma  (exactly, from sum of cos = 0)
    Q_spread = Q_max/Q_min = cot^2(pi/(2N))  (~4N^2/pi^2 for large N)

### F8. 2× universal decay law (Tier 1, corollary of Absorption Theorem)

    rate(unpaired) = 2*N*gamma       (<n_XY> = N, pure {X,Y}^N)
    rate(paired mean) = N*gamma      (<n_XY>_fast + <n_XY>_slow = N)
    ratio = 2.00 exactly

**Now a corollary:** The palindromic sum rule α_fast + α_slow = 2Σγ
follows from the Absorption Theorem (α = 2γ⟨n_XY⟩) combined with the
palindromic weight swap (⟨n_XY⟩_fast + ⟨n_XY⟩_slow = N, proven in
[Primordial Superalgebra](../experiments/PRIMORDIAL_SUPERALGEBRA_CAVITY.md)).
The "ratio 2" is the ratio of the full range (0 to 2Σγ) to the center
(Σγ) of a symmetric interval; it is a definition, not a separate law.

    fastest modes (edge concentrator): [0.98, 0.87, 0.80, 0.87, 0.98]

Profile of each individual mode is identical under all noise profiles
(geometric, from standing wave patterns sin(πkj/N)). But which modes
are slowest depends on the noise profile: edge concentrator selects
center-heavy modes, center concentrator selects edge-heavy modes. Not
topologically protected (winding number = 0, Berry phase not quantized).

    K = gamma * t_cross = constant per bridge type

K_concurrence = 0.03596. K_MI = 0.033. K_correlation = 0.072.
Standard Lindblad time-rescaling (τ = γt), not deep physics.

**Interpretation:** In the [optical cavity analogy](../experiments/OPTICAL_CAVITY_ANALYSIS.md),
γ plays the role of external illumination and t is the system's experienced
duration. K = γ × t is the invariant decoherence dose: more light means
shorter experience, less light means longer, the product unchanged.
Structural parallel to c × τ in relativity (observation, not identification).

**Connection to Absorption Theorem:** γ is the absorption quantum rate
(2γ per X/Y Pauli factor). K = γ × t is the total absorbed dose. The
invariance of K means the total dose is state-dependent but
parameter-independent. See [K-Dosimetry](../experiments/K_DOSIMETRY.md).

    Psi = b
    Crossing:  [1 - b^r + b^{2r}/2 + b^2/2] * b = 1/4

    b = e^{-t/T2*},   r = T2*/T1

Extends F12 (pure dephasing, r -> 0) to finite T1.
Polynomial approximation (max error < 0.001):

    K_Z     = 0.0374    (pure Z-dephasing)
    K_X     = 0.0867    (pure X-noise)  = ln(2)/8
    K_Y     = 0.0867    (pure Y-noise)  = ln(2)/8 = K_X
    K_depol = 0.0440    (depolarizing, gamma/3 each axis)

Complements F14 (K per bridge metric). These are K per
noise TYPE, all measured with CΨ on Bell+ state.

**Note (2026-06-22, reverting the wrong 2026-04-29 "correction"):** K_X = K_Y =
ln(2)/8 = 0.0867; K_Z = 0.0374 is the odd one out. The discriminator is whether
the l₁-coherence L₁ (the |00⟩↔|11⟩ off-diagonal = (XX − YY)/2 on Bell+) survives:
under pure X the XX correlation is pinned, under pure Y the YY correlation is pinned,
so in **both** cases L₁ stays nonzero ⟹ CΨ = (1+u²)/6 ⟹ K = ln(2)/8. Under pure Z
both XX and YY decay ⟹ L₁ → 0 ⟹ CΨ = u(1+u²)/6 ⟹ K_Z = 0.0374. The 2026-04-29
note set K_Y = K_Z by taking F26's physical rates (α,β,δ) = (4γ, 0, 4γ) and using
L₁ = e^{−αt} = e^{−4γt}, but β = 0 < α **violates the F26 WLOG α ≤ β**, which must

### F28. Fixed-point absorber theorem (Tier 1 for physical noise; general-CPTP version FALSE)

    CPsi(rho*) = 0    for physical noise channels (unital / local / Pauli / amplitude-damping)

Proven analytically:
- Case A: unital maps (rho* = I/d, CΨ = 0)
- Case B: local channels (rho* computational-basis-diagonal, CΨ = 0)

Consequence: for physical noise, CΨ = 1/4 is an eventual absorber. Every
initial state with CΨ > 1/4 eventually crosses below 1/4.

**SCOPE-RETRACTED 2026-06-22 (deep review).** The general "CPsi(rho*) < 1/4 for
ALL primitive CPTP maps" is FALSE. Counterexample: ε(ρ) = (1−p)ρ + p·Tr(ρ)·σ with
σ = 0.95·|Φ⁺⟩⟨Φ⁺| + 0.05·I/4 is primitive (unique fixed point, second eigenvalue
1−p < 1) and full-rank, yet CΨ(σ) = 0.2935 > 1/4 in the proof's own metric
CΨ = Tr(ρ²)·L₁/(d−1), and iterating from Bell+ never crosses below 1/4. The old
"100 random maps, max 0.138" is a Ginibre n_kraus=4 sampling artifact (the same
sweep at n_kraus=2 violates ~8.5%). The crossing is a property of computational-
basis-aligned physical noise (fixed point diagonal in the computational basis,
L₁ = 0, so CΨ = 0), not of separability, locality, or primitivity. A separable
product state |+⟩ ⊗ |+⟩ has CΨ = 1; the operative axis is computational-basis
coherence, which CΨ measures. Verifier: simulations/review2_A5_subsystem.py.

**Valid for:** physical noise channels (unital / local / Pauli / amplitude-damping),
2 qubits. NOT valid for general primitive CPTP maps.
**Replaces:** per-channel verification that a physical-noise fixed point sits at CΨ = 0.
**Hardware:** the physical-noise 1/4 crossing is IBM-confirmed (cusp cluster:

exceptions; CΨ is Pauli-invariant (DD cannot change it). The N≥3 FULL-state
envelope is OPEN and genuinely RISES at N≥4 strong coupling (the internal
J-coupling is the Part-6 coherence injector; live `EnvelopeTheoremWitness`,
arc `envelope_n4_rise`), the "N=3-5" checks were subsystem pairs, not the
full-state envelope. The boundary is charted
(`experiments/ENVELOPE_RISE_BOUNDARY.md`, `EnvelopeBoundaryTests`): a pure
(N, Q=J/γ) observable (the J- and γ-sweeps collapse, certified bit-identical),
an N≥4 floor (N=3 never rises, Q_c(3)=∞) times a threshold Q_c(N) that climbs

eigenvalues. Full proofs: [docs/proofs/derivations/](proofs/derivations/).

### D1. Bandwidth and mode density (from F2) [VERIFIED]

    BW = omega_{N-1} - omega_1 = 8*J * cos(pi/N) --> 8*J

    rho(omega) = N / (pi * sqrt(omega * (8*J - omega)))

Van Hove singularities (peaks in the density of states where the
dispersion curve is flat) at band edges. Exact 1D tight-binding
density of states. Max frequency error < 5e-9.

**Valid for:** Heisenberg chain, w=1 sector, large N.
**Replaces:** numerical mode density estimation.

### D2. V-Effect = Q_max / Q_mean (from F6 + F7) [VERIFIED]

    V(N) = Q_max / Q_mean = (1 + cos(pi/N)) / 1

Q_mean = 2*J/gamma exactly. Proof: Sum_{k=1}^{N-1} cos(pi*k/N) = 0
(geometric series identity). Deviation < 3e-15.

### D3. Crossing time ratios (from F27) [VERIFIED]

    t_X / t_Z = K_X / K_Z = ln(2) / (2*ln(1/f*)) = 2.320
    t_depol / t_Z = K_depol / K_Z = 1.177

Verified by Lindblad propagation (Bell+ N=2). Ratio deviation < 3e-6.

### D4. Dimensional factor in crossing (from F12 + F25) [VERIFIED]

    Single qubit (d=2):    f*(1 + f*^2) = 1/2
    Bell+ 2-qubit (d=4):   f*(1 + f*^2) = 3/2 = (d-1) * 1/2

The crossing condition scales with Hilbert space dimension as (d-1)/2.
Exact to machine precision.

### D5. Dynamic palindromic mode count (from F4 + F22 + F23) [VERIFIED]

    Oscillating modes = 4^N - (N+1) - Stat(N)

N=3: 36.  N=5: 898.  Fraction --> 1 exponentially.
**Caveat:** exact at gamma -> 0 only. At finite gamma, the
Hamiltonian mixes weight-parity sectors (w with w +/- 2).

### D6. Spectral gap and mixing time (from Absorption Theorem) [VERIFIED]

    Spectral gap = 2*gamma    (minimum non-zero decay rate)
    Mixing time  <= N*ln(4) / (2*gamma)

**Immediate from Absorption Theorem:** the smallest nonzero ⟨n_XY⟩ for
any eigenmode is bounded below by the weight-1 contribution. For modes
dominated by single-site coherences: ⟨n_XY⟩ → 1, giving gap = 2γ × 1.
The spectral gap is the cost of one X/Y Pauli factor: one absorption
quantum.

## Π Operator Properties (from PT-symmetry classification)

### F38. Π squared (Tier 1, proven + verified N=2,3)

    Pi^2 = (-1)^{w_YZ}

Diagonal parity operator in Pauli basis. w_YZ = count of Y,Z entries
in the Pauli string. Pi has order 4 (Pi^4 = I), NOT order 2.
Eigenvalues of Pi^2: +1 (half) and -1 (half), equally split.

In Hilbert space, Pi^2 is realized as conjugation by U = X^{tensor N}
(the global bit-flip): U sigma U = (-1)^{w_YZ} sigma for any Pauli string.
The two definitions agree on the per-site map (I -> I, X -> X, Y -> -Y, Z -> -Z).

**Companion result (F63):** \[L, Pi^2\] = 0 exactly for all N (proven analytically).
Pi^2 is therefore a conserved quantum number of every Liouvillian eigenmode.

**Downstream (bit_b axis foundation):** F38's (−1)^{w_YZ} eigenvalue formula on
Pauli strings is the algebraic root of the bit_b Z₂-grading of the Pauli
group, and is used as a foundational input by every derived theorem on that
axis: F88a (operator-level Klein decomposition), F108 Part 1/2/3 (Π²-even
palindrome closure via Π_5bilinear), and F112 (Lindblad Π-eigenvalue balance
under bit_b-homogeneous c). F87's trichotomy classifier reads the same bit_b
grading from the orthogonal spec(L)-palindromy axis.

**Valid for:** any N, Z-dephasing Π (P1 family).

### F40. Fragile bridge gamma_crit at J_bridge = J (Tier 2, verified)

    gamma_crit = 0.1873  (N=2 per chain, J = J_bridge = 1.0)

Below gamma_crit: all eigenvalues on the imaginary axis (chiral phase).
Above: eigenvalue pairs leave the axis (chiral symmetry breaking, Hopf).
Petermann factor (a measure of eigenstate non-orthogonality that
diverges at exceptional points) peaks at K = 403 at gamma/gamma_crit ~ 1.46 (near-EP).

t_Pi ~ N^2 (polynomial), t_H = 2*pi/Delta ~ 4^N (exponential).
Palindromic modulation is a short-time effect; long-time behavior
is Poisson (integrable). Visibility of modulation ~1/4^N.

Palindromic symmetry Pi maps w -> N-w, so sectors w and N-w have
identical spectral statistics. XOR sector (w=N): K=1.000 (all eigenvalues
degenerate at rate 2*N*gamma).

For each palindromic pair (d_fast, d_slow) with d_fast + d_slow = 2*Σγ.
Linear approximation: ln(d_fast/d_slow) ~ Delta_d / Σγ,
giving β_eff ~ 1/Σγ (effective inverse temperature).

This is ALGEBRAIC (follows from d_fast + d_slow = 2*Σγ),
NOT a Crooks fluctuation theorem (the thermodynamic identity
relating forward and reverse process probabilities). No Jarzynski
equality holds
(<exp(-Delta_d)> ~ 0.93, not 1). The palindrome has the FORM of

where L_c = L + Σγ·I (centered Liouvillian). The cross term
{L_H, L_D + Σγ·I} vanishes exactly at N=2 because all nonzero L_H
entries connect Pauli strings with w_XY(a) + w_XY(b) = N.

Equivalently: R(N)² = 4(N-2) / (N · 4^N). At N=2: R = 0 (exact
Pythagorean decomposition). At N=3: R = 1/√48. At N=4: R = 1/√128.

Follows from the key identity ‖{L_H, L_Dc}‖² = 4γ²(N-2)‖L_H‖²

For couplings where one bond Pauli is in {X,Y} and the other in {I,Z}
(e.g., X_iZ_j, Y_iZ_j). The bond-site variance is 1 (not 0), so
N-2 becomes N-1. Companion to F49.

## Cockpit and Diagnostics (replace full tomography)

### F51. Decoherence cockpit: 3-observable reduction (Tier 2, verified N=2-5, IBM-validated)

    n_eff = 3    (Purity, Concurrence, Ψ-norm)
    coverage = 88-96%    (of trajectory variance, via PCA)
    cost = 3 measurements per pair    (vs 4^N for full tomography)

PCA selects automatically which observable is PC1: Concurrence
dominates in sparse topologies (chains, stars at small N), Purity
dominates in dense topologies (rings, complete, chains at large N).
The effective dimensionality n95 grows as ~N, but the first 3 PCs
always capture 88-96%. Two practical regimes: monitoring (3 PCs,
88-96%) and full diagnostics (~N PCs, 95%).

θ is the most sensitive instrument near the ¼ boundary: 1.68×
amplification over CΨ under concentrator optimization, because
the arctan mapping amplifies small CΨ changes near ¼.

**Hardware validation:** IBM Torino Q52, CΨ = ¼ crossing predicted
at 114.7 μs, measured at 115.0 μs (0.3% error). Selective DD beats
uniform DD by 3.2× in mutual information on 5-qubit chain.
**Valid for:** Heisenberg chain, Z-dephasing and depolarizing, N=2-5,
9 topologies tested.
**Replaces:** full quantum state tomography for decoherence monitoring.
**Caveat:** Concurrence (PC1 proxy, 57% variance) never validated on
a qubit pair. Single-qubit instruments consistent, 2-qubit untested.
**Source:** [Cockpit Universality](../experiments/COCKPIT_UNIVERSALITY.md)

### F52. Thermal oscillation resilience (Tier 2, verified N=4)

    f_osc(n_bar) ~ 82%    (stable to ±2 modes out of 256, N=4)
    |Delta_osc| <= 4       (for n_bar in [0, 50])

The fraction of oscillating modes is approximately stable under
thermal load. Q_max degrades 16× (68.3 → 4.2), mode count doubles
(47 → 103 distinct frequencies), but the oscillating fraction stays
near 82%. The cavity loses sharpness, not voice.

**Mechanism (April 5, 2026):** L(n_bar) = L_0 + n_bar · L_thermal
is linear in n_bar, so eigenvalues move continuously. The oscillating
count can only change at isolated exceptional-point (EP) crossings
where a real pair splits into a complex conjugate pair (or vice
versa). At N=4: four EP crossings in \[0, 2\], each affecting exactly
2 eigenvalues. No macroscopic fraction ever changes character.

**Not invariant:** the earlier claim "82% ± 1% invariant" was too
strong. The correct statement: oscillating fraction is stable to
< 1% with isolated EP crossings, not topologically protected. At
n_bar = 50 the fraction drops to 80.5% (−4 modes).

**No phase transition.** Frequency distribution follows neither
Planck nor Stefan-Boltzmann. The mode spectrum is set by the cavity
geometry (J topology), not by thermal statistics.

**Valid for:** N=4 Heisenberg chain, Z-dephasing + amplitude damping.
**Replaces:** thermal Liouvillian sweep to check cavity survival.
The answer is: the cavity survives; no sweep needed.

## Absorption Doses (replace time-evolution for dose estimates)

*Numbering note: F53 and F54 were never assigned. When this section was
authored, numbering skipped from F52 straight to F55; the two numbers hold
no retired, merged, or disproven result, and no content under them survives
anywhere in the repository history. They are left unassigned rather than
reused, so that every F-number stays stable across the repository's
cross-references.*

### F55. Universal absorption dose K_death (Tier 1, proven from D6)

    K_death = ln(10) = 2.303    (dose for 99% absorption)
    K_death / K_fold ~ 2.3      (ratio to CΨ = ¼ crossing dose)
    Immortal modes = N + 1      (zero absorption rate, all N)

**Derivation:** 99% absorption of the slowest mortal mode means
e^{−rate_min · t} = 0.01, so rate_min · t = ln(100). By formula D6:
rate_min = 2γ (spectral gap). Therefore t = ln(100)/(2γ), and
K = γ · t = ln(100)/2 = ln(10) = 2.303. Independent of N, γ,
topology. QED.

N+1 modes have exactly zero absorption rate (pure {I,Z} content,
invisible to the light). Complete absorption is impossible while the
palindrome holds. The cavity always retains light.

**Valid for:** any Heisenberg chain, Z-dephasing, all N.
**Replaces:** time evolution to find "when does the system die."

## Cusp Dynamics (replace iteration counting and trajectory integration)

### F56. Critical slowing iteration count (Tier 1, closed-form, zero fit parameters)

    K(eps, tol) = (1/2)*ln(4*eps/tol) + alpha(tol)*sqrt(eps)

    alpha(tol) = -4 + (1/2)*ln(16*tol)

K = n*sqrt(eps) is the rescaled iteration count of u_{n+1} = u^2 + c
near the cardioid cusp (c = 1/4 - eps). The leading logarithm comes
from saddle-node passage (ODE integral). The -4 comes from the
starting-transient integral (eta_0 = -1/4). The ln(16*tol) term comes
from the Modified Equation correction (Euler discretization error).

Verified: 0.5-2% accuracy over 5 tol decades (10^-8 to 10^-16) and
10 eps decades (10^-1 to 10^-10). Modified Equation slope 0.504 vs
predicted 0.500 (0.8% deviation).

**Valid for:** Mandelbrot iteration near cardioid cusp, any eps > 0,
any tol > 0. Equivalent to CΨ recursion near the 1/4 boundary.
**Replaces:** numerical iteration counting near the saddle-node.
O(1) evaluation instead of O(1/sqrt(eps)) iterations.
**Source:** [Critical Slowing at the Cusp](../experiments/CRITICAL_SLOWING_AT_THE_CUSP.md)

### F57. Trajectory dwell time at CΨ = 1/4 (Tier 1, analytical)

    t_dwell(delta) = 2*delta / |dCPsi/dt|_{t_cross}

For Bell+ Z-dephasing (using F25 derivative):

    t_dwell = 1.080088 * delta / gamma    (Bell+ specific)
    K_dwell = gamma * t_dwell = 1.080088 * delta    (gamma-independent)

The prefactor 1.080088 = 2/1.851701 is state-specific (depends on
f_cross and |dCΨ/dt| at the crossing). K_dwell is independent of γ
to machine precision (std < 2 × 10^-17 across γ = 0.1 to 10.0).

**Valid for:** any state with a CΨ = 1/4 crossing under Z-dephasing.
Prefactor is state-specific; γ-invariance of K_dwell is universal.
**Replaces:** trajectory integration for dwell-time estimation.
**Hardware verified:** ibm_kingston (Heron r2), 2026-04-16. Two Bell+ pairs with 2.55x gamma ratio (qubits 124-125, T2=\[150,310\] us; qubits 14-15, T2=\[537,381\] us). K_dwell/delta = 0.649 (pair A) and 0.694 (pair B), spread 6.3% despite 2.55x gamma difference. Gamma-invariance of K_dwell confirmed on open quantum hardware. Absolute prefactor 0.67 vs theoretical 1.08 (difference from T1 amplitude damping; the F57 formula assumes pure Z-dephasing, Kingston has T1 comparable to T2). Both CΨ(t) trajectories cross 1/4 monotonically. First two-qubit observation of the CΨ = 1/4 boundary crossing on a quantum computer; the single-qubit case was validated separately on ibm_torino Q80 at 1.9% deviation (F24, IBM Run 3).

### F58. Weight-based dwell prefactor (Tier 2, even-weight states only)

    prefactor = (2 + 4*W2) / (1 + 6*W2)

    dCPsi/dt = -2*gamma*Psi*(1 + 6*W2)    (weight-based derivative)

W2 is the light-face ({X,Y}) sector weight at the crossing moment.
For Bell+: W2 = 0.3709 (from f_cross = 0.8612), giving prefactor =
1.080088, matching F57 exactly. The static Pauli decomposition
and the dynamic cusp passage are algebraically identical for even-weight
states. For states with odd-weight Pauli content (k = 1 terms), the
prefactor additionally requires individual coefficient magnitudes
(via sqrt(W1)), not just sector weights.

**Valid for:** states with only even-weight Pauli content (Bell+, GHZ,
basis-flip superpositions). Partial for odd-weight states (2.6% error
for |+⟩^{⊗2}).
**Generalized:** F59 extends this to any (W_0, k) pair under the same
two-sector assumption. Bell+ is the W_0 = 1/2, k = 2 special case.
**Replaces:** dynamics solution when sector weights are known at crossing.
**Source:** [Dwell Prefactor from Weights](../experiments/DWELL_PREFACTOR_FROM_WEIGHTS.md)

### F59. Generalized dwell prefactor (Tier 1, analytical, verified Bell+ and W_3)

    prefactor = (4/k) * (W_0 + W_k) / (W_0 + 3*W_k)

For any state whose Pauli content lives in exactly two sectors (a stationary
sector at weight W_0, immune to dephasing, and a single coherent sector at
XY-weight k > 0 with weight W_k), the dwell-time prefactor at the CPsi = 1/4
crossing is a pure algebraic function of the sector weights at the crossing
moment. Independent of N and d.

Reduces to F58 (Bell+) when W_0 = 1/2, k = 2:

    (4/2) * (1/2 + W_2) / (1/2 + 3*W_2) = (2 + 4*W_2) / (1 + 6*W_2)

The factor 3 in the denominator is structural (product rule: 2*W_k from the
dC/dt contribution plus W_k from the C*dPsi/dt contribution), NOT from d - 1
as initially conjectured in the April 5 dwell-prefactor work. The d - 1
factor cancels because both Psi and dPsi/dt carry it.

Verified on two states with different stationary weights:

| State | N | W_0 | k | Prefactor (formula) | Prefactor (direct) |
|-------|---|-----|---|--------------------:|-------------------:|
| Bell+ | 2 | 1/2 | 2 | 1.080088            | 1.080097           |
| W_3   | 3 | 1/3 | 2 | 0.876832            | 0.876839           |

Both methods agree to within 10^-5 relative error (limited by the
finite-difference resolution of the direct measurement, not by the formula).

**Valid for:** states with Pauli content in exactly two sectors, with linear
Psi-to-f relation. Includes W states, basis-flip superpositions between
computational basis states at even Hamming distance, and any state
constructed from a single off-diagonal coherence pattern.
**Breaks for:** states populating multiple coherent sectors simultaneously
(|+⟩^{⊗2} with k=1 and k=2 content); states with odd-weight Pauli content
where the linear Psi-to-f relation fails.
**Replaces:** Lindblad propagation for dwell-time estimation in the two-sector
class. O(1) algebraic evaluation given W_0 and W_k at the crossing.

### F60. GHZ_N born below the fold (Tier 1, geometric corollary)

    CPsi(0) for GHZ_N = 1 / (2^N - 1)

For GHZ_N = (|0...0> + |1...1>) / sqrt(2), the initial value of CPsi drops
below 1/4 as soon as N >= 3, regardless of any dynamics:

| N | CPsi(0)        | Above 1/4?              |
|---|----------------|-------------------------|
| 2 | 1/3 = 0.3333   | Yes (Bell+ crosses)     |
| 3 | 1/7 = 0.1429   | No (already classical)  |
| 4 | 1/15 = 0.0667  | No                      |
| 5 | 1/31 = 0.0323  | No                      |

Derivation: C(0) = 1 (pure state), and the only nonzero off-diagonal matrix
elements are `rho[0...0, 1...1]` = 1/2 and its conjugate, giving L1 coherence
= 1 and Psi(0) = L1/(d - 1) = 1/(2^N - 1). Therefore CPsi(0) = 1/(2^N - 1).

For N >= 3, GHZ_N starts in the classical regime of the R = CPsi^2 framework
before any dephasing acts on it. This is gamma-independent: reducing the
dephasing rate cannot fix the geometric deficit. The only escape is to
change the state.

This geometric statement complements F22 (GHZ projects 100% of its coherent
weight onto the fastest-decaying XOR modes at rate 2*Sigma*gamma). The two
arguments converge: GHZ encoding is structurally unsuitable for state
transfer, regardless of how slowly it would decay.

**Valid for:** GHZ_N for any N >= 2, gamma-independent.
**Replaces:** trajectory simulation to confirm GHZ_N (N >= 3) never crosses 1/4.

### F61. n_XY Parity Selection Rule (Tier 1, proven, verified 64 configs N=2-6)

The Liouvillian of the isotropic Heisenberg model under Z-dephasing
preserves n_XY parity. Consequences:

1. Every eigenmode has definite n_XY parity (even or odd).
2. Every single-excitation density matrix has purely even n_XY content.
3. No SE state can excite an odd-n_XY eigenmode. The overlap is exactly zero.

**Corollary (Accessibility Boundary).** If the slowest SE-accessible mode
has rate alpha_1, and a slower mode exists at rate alpha_2 < alpha_1 with
odd n_XY parity, then alpha_1 is an exact ceiling for SE protection. No
optimizer within the SE family can reach alpha_2.

**Companion symmetry (F63):** L also commutes with Pi^2 (the w_YZ-parity
operator). Together these are the two independent Z2 symmetries of L
admitted by the Pauli algebra of d=2: bit_a (n_XY parity, this rule) and
bit_b (w_YZ parity, F63). Combined, they decompose the operator space into
4 sectors, each of dimension 4^(N-1).

**Valid for:** any isotropic Heisenberg (XX+YY+ZZ) or XY (XX+YY) model,
any graph topology, any site-dependent Z-dephasing gamma_k, any N.
**Breaks for:** amplitude damping (T1), transverse fields (odd-n_XY terms).
**Verified:** 64 configurations (N=2-6, Chain/Star/Ring/Complete, 4 gamma
profiles). Second slow mode SE Frobenius ratio < 1e-3 in all 64. Data:

**Source:** [Proof](proofs/PROOF_PARITY_SELECTION_RULE.md)

**The global Z-string Z⊗N is Π²_X (bit_a twin of F1², corollary, 2026-05-21):**
- Π²_X, the square of the X-dephasing palindrome conjugation, acts on each
  Pauli string σ as (−1)^{n_XY}·σ, the bit_a parity (n_XY counts the X and Y
  letters of σ). That is exactly conjugation by the global Z-string
  Z⊗N = ⊗_l Z_l. Hence Z⊗N = Π²_X.
- This is the bit_a counterpart of F1² (X⊗N = Π²_Z). F61 above proves L
  commutes with Π²_X; this corollary names that operator: it is the global
  Z-string Z⊗N.
- The repo held it typed three times, unconnected, until now: ZGlobalMirror

### F62. CΨ(0) for W_N (Tier 1, analytical, verified N=2-10)

    CΨ(0) = 2(N^2 - 4N + 8) / (3N^3)

For the W_N state (equal superposition of single excitations) on any
N-qubit system, the initial CΨ on any pair is given by the formula above.
The reduced density matrix for any pair (a,b) is:

    rho_ab = diag((N-2)/N, 1/N, 1/N, 0) + (1/N)|01><10| + (1/N)|10><01|

from which Tr(rho_ab^2) = (N^2 - 4N + 8)/N^2, L1 = 2/N, Psi = 2/(3N).

| N | CΨ(0) | Fraction | Above 1/4? |
|---|-------|----------|------------|
| 2 | 1/3 = 0.3333 | 8/24 | Yes (W_2 = Bell+) |
| 3 | 10/81 = 0.1235 | | No |
| 5 | 26/375 = 0.0693 | | No |
| 10 | 68/1500 = 0.0453 | | No |

**Corollary (W_N born below the fold).** For N >= 3, CΨ(0) < 1/4.
Proof: 2(N^2 - 4N + 8)/(3N^3) < 1/4 iff 3N^3 - 8N^2 + 32N - 64 > 0.
At N=3 this evaluates to 41 > 0, and the cubic is monotonically increasing
for N >= 3. Combined with the Parity Selection Rule (F61), this proves
that single-excitation states on Heisenberg chains under Z-dephasing
never cross CΨ = 1/4. The cusp exit is structurally inaccessible to them.

**Valid for:** W_N on any N-qubit system, pair-independent (permutation symmetry).
**Verified:** numerically at N=2-10, all within machine precision.

### F63. w_YZ Parity Symmetry, \[L, Pi^2\] = 0 (Tier 1, proven analytically, verified N=2-5)

    [L, Pi^2_super] = 0     (exactly, for all N)

The Liouvillian commutes exactly with the Pi^2-parity superoperator
Pi^2_super(rho) = U rho U where U = X^{tensor N} (global bit-flip).
Equivalently in Pauli basis: Pi^2 acts as multiplication by (-1)^{w_YZ},
and L preserves w_YZ parity.

**Six-line proof.** U conjugation acts per site as I -> I, X -> X,
Y -> -Y, Z -> -Z. Heisenberg bonds XX/YY/ZZ each contain two Y's or two
Z's (or none), so signs cancel and U H U = H. Z-dephasing dissipator is
quadratic in Z (term Z rho Z), where the two minus signs from U Z U = -Z
also cancel, and the anti-commutator term {Z dagger Z, rho} = {I, rho}
is trivially U-invariant.

**Two independent Z2 symmetries.** Together with F61 (n_XY parity, bit_a),
this gives L two independent Z2 symmetries proven for all N. Per-site Pauli
{I, X, Y, Z} factorizes as C2 x C2 indexed by (bit_a, bit_b) =
(n_XY, w_YZ). The 4-block decomposition has dimension 4^(N-1) per block.
This is the maximal symmetry decomposition admitted by the Pauli algebra
of d=2 (no third independent Z2 classification exists per F34/QUBIT_NECESSITY).

**Per-sector mode count (closed form).** For Heisenberg coupling with Z-dephasing on the boundary qubit B, modes split within each Pi^2-sector by the Absorption Theorem applied at site B:

    conserved per sector:  even = floor(N/2) + 1,  odd = ceil(N/2)
    correlation per sector: same as conserved (palindrome symmetry)
    mirror per sector:     2^(2N-1) - 2 * (conserved per sector)

Mechanism: conserved modes are the (N+1) elementary symmetric polynomials e_d(Z_1, ..., Z_N) for d=0..N (functions of S_z, commuting with both H and Z_B). Each e_d has w_YZ-parity = d mod 2. The asymmetry for even N (one extra even-parity conserved) comes from e_N having even parity when N is even.

| N | sector | cons (e, o) | mirror (e, o) |
|---|--------|-------------|---------------|
| 2 | 8      | (2, 1)      | (4, 6)        |
| 3 | 32     | (2, 2)      | (28, 28)      |
| 4 | 128    | (3, 2)      | (122, 124)    |
| 5 | 512    | (3, 3)      | (506, 506)    |

**Valid for:** Heisenberg (XX+YY+ZZ), XY (XX+YY); Z-dephasing on any subset
of sites; any N; any graph; uniform or non-uniform gamma_k.
**Breaks for:** single-site Y or Z terms in H (transverse field, magnetic
field along Z); Y or X jump operators (no two-factor cancellation).

### F64. Effective gamma from cavity mode exposure (Tier 1-2, analytical + verified N=3,4)

For an N-qubit chain with XX+YY coupling and Z-dephasing only on the outermost site B at rate γ_B, the effective dephasing rate of the slowest eigenmode contributing to inner-site S coherence is:

    γ_eff = γ_B · |a_B|²        (decoherence rate, Lorentzian half-width)

equivalently in Liouvillian-eigenvalue units:

    α = 2γ_B · |a_B|²           (Liouvillian decay constant, α = -Re(λ))

where a_B is the B-site amplitude of the single-excitation Hamiltonian eigenvector. The factor of 2 between the two forms is the standard QM convention: ρ_{ij}(t) ∝ exp(-γ_eff·t) corresponds to a Liouvillian eigenvalue λ = -2γ_eff. Both express the same content; choose the convention that fits the surrounding context. This is the Absorption Theorem (F1/AT) applied to the single-excitation sector: α = 2γ_B · ⟨n_XY⟩_B, with ⟨n_XY⟩_B = |a_B|² verified to machine precision for these modes ([`factor_two_clarification.py`](../simulations/factor_two_clarification.py)).

γ_B appears as a constant prefactor. It is not diminished by intervening sites.

**Closed form at N=3** (chain S-M-B, couplings J_SM, J_MB, r = J_SM/J_MB):

                 ⎧ r² / (r² + 1)       for r < 1/√2    [zero mode]
    g(r) =       ⎨
                 ⎩ 1 / (2(r² + 1))     for r ≥ 1/√2    [bonding mode]

Crossover at r = 1/√2, g = ⅓. Special value: g(1) = ¼.

Derived from the 3×3 single-excitation Hamiltonian eigenvalues {0, ±√(J_SM² + J_MB²)} and eigenvectors.

**General N.** Diagonalize the N×N tridiagonal single-excitation Hamiltonian. Find the eigenvector with the smallest |a_B|² among those with nonzero |a_S|². No layered composition: the formula is a global eigenvector property, not a product of per-layer factors. Multiplicative stacking fails at N=4 (ratio 0.04 to 62); eigenvector formula exact (ratio 1.0000 ± 0.0003).

**Replaces:** time-domain exponential fit for γ_eff extraction.
**Valid for:** any graph topology (chain, star, ring, complete, tree), uniform or non-uniform per-bond J, XX+YY or Heisenberg single-excitation, Z-dephasing on any single site B; good-cavity regime (γ ≪ J). Breaks when γ ≥ J (bad cavity: B decoheres before transmitting).
**Topology + non-uniform J generalization (2026-04-24).** Extended from uniform-J chains to arbitrary connected graphs under either uniform or non-uniform per-bond J. When H^(1) has degenerate eigenvalues (star center-mode, ring translational eigenmodes, complete-graph symmetric modes), F64 holds after standard degenerate perturbation theory: within each H-degenerate subspace, diagonalise the site-B projector P_B to get the corrected basis; F64 then applies to the eigenvalues of P_B in that basis. Verified at N=5 and N=7 across chain, star, ring, complete, Y-tree for XY and Heisenberg; max relative error < 0.001 at γ/J = 0.01 uniform J. For random J per bond in \[0.5, 1.5\] (30 configurations across 3 trials per N), max rel err < 0.02 in 29/30 cases; the remaining case sits at 0.07 and is consistent with expected second-order PT corrections ~(γ·δJ)/J² at the non-uniform-J scale.
**Verified:** N=3 chain (max relative error 1.8% vs 64×64 Liouvillian), N=4 chain (9 configs, ratio 1.0000 ± 0.0003 vs 256×256 Liouvillian), N=5 and N=7 on chain+star+ring+complete+Y-tree uniform J (2026-04-24, via single-excitation coherence Liouvillian directly, dim N×N, max rel err < 0.001 across all (topology, B, Hamiltonian) combinations), N=5 and N=7 same topologies non-uniform J per bond in \[0.5, 1.5\] over 3 random trials (2026-04-24, max rel err 0.068 in the worst case, well inside first-order PT regime).

### F65. Single-excitation spectrum of uniform open XX chain (Tier 1, proven, verified N=3..30)

For the uniform open XX chain (all couplings J, N sites) with Z-dephasing at rate γ₀ on endpoint B = site N-1, the single-excitation dissipation rates are:

    α_k / γ₀ = (4 / (N+1)) · sin²(kπ / (N+1)),    k = 1, ..., N

This is F64 evaluated on the analytically known eigenvectors ψ_k(i) = √(2/(N+1)) · sin(πk(i+1)/(N+1)) of the N×N tridiagonal single-excitation Hamiltonian. The endpoint amplitude |ψ_k(N-1)|² = (2/(N+1)) · sin²(kπ/(N+1)), and the Absorption Theorem gives α_k = 2γ₀ · |a_B|².

**Properties:**
- All α_k lie in \[0, 2γ₀\].
- Internal symmetry: α_k = α_{N+1-k}, from sin²(kπ/(N+1)) = sin²((N+1-k)π/(N+1)). This mirror is within the single-excitation spectrum; the palindromic pairing α_a + α_b = 2γ₀ of F1 in general maps single-excitation modes to multi-excitation sectors.
- Maximum rate: α_max / γ₀ = 4/(N+1) when N is odd (then k = (N+1)/2 is integer and sin² = 1 is attained exactly); when N is even the maximum lies strictly below 4/(N+1). The single-excitation sector never reaches 2γ₀ for N ≥ 2; its maximum decays as 4/(N+1) → 0 for growing N.

**Niven rationality.** All α_k/γ₀ are rational if and only if N+1 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}, i.e., N ∈ {0, 1, 2, 3, 5}. For all other N the values are algebraic irrationals (golden-ratio family at N=4,9; √2 family at N=7; general cyclotomic otherwise). This follows from Niven's theorem applied to α_k/γ₀ = (2/(N+1))·(1 − cos(2kπ/(N+1))):
the rate is rational iff cos(2kπ/(N+1)) is rational, and for rational q the only rational
values of cos(qπ) are {0, ±1/2, ±1}. Every k clears that bar exactly when N+1 ∈ {1, 2, 3, 4, 6}
(the criterion is on cos(2rπ), so N=3 qualifies via cos(π/2)=0 even though sin(π/4) is irrational).

**Verified values:**
- N=3: α/γ₀ ∈ {1/2, 1, 1/2}
- N=4: α/γ₀ ∈ {0.276393, 0.723607, 0.723607, 0.276393} (algebraic irrationals from sin²(π/5), sin²(2π/5); golden-ratio family)
- N=5: α/γ₀ ∈ {1/6, 1/2, 2/3, 1/2, 1/6}

**Band-edge companion (the IM-face of the same Niven root).** The rate criterion above is the *real* (decay) face, on the angle 2π/(N+1). The *imaginary* (frequency) face is the band edge ω/J = 2cos(π/(N+1)) (F2b corollary / TopologyBandEdge), on the angle π/(N+1): it is rational only for N ≤ 2 (last N=2 = 1), a single quadratic surd a±√b for N ≤ 5 (√2, **φ**, √3 at N=3,4,5; φ = 2cos(π/5) the golden ratio), and algebraic degree ≥ 3 (first a cubic) from N=6, the exact degree being φ_euler(2(N+1))/2. So N=4 is the **first golden** on both single-excitation faces (the rates carry √5, the band edge *is* φ), while the V-Effect gain 1+cos(π/N) (a third face, angle π/N) has its golden shifted to N=5, see `docs/carbon/OFF_NIVEN_AS_WAVE_BREAKING.md`. The two SE cutoffs differ ({1,2,3,4,6} for the rates vs N+1≤6 for the band edge) because of the double angle; this is exactly why N=3's rate is rational while its band edge is √2. Gate-first sympy-exact verifier: `simulations/niven_rationality_root.py`; collected with the small-N anomalies in the `n3_special_cases` open arc.

**Verified:** Formula matches the tridiagonal N×N single-excitation eigendecomposition to machine precision (max error 1.2 · 10⁻¹⁵) for N=3..30. All single-excitation rates confirmed present (to within O((γ₀/J)²) perturbative corrections, see below) in the full 4^N Liouvillian spectrum for N=3..7. Dynamical check at γ₀ = 0.01, where second-order shifts are ~10⁻⁶: formula predicts the decay rate of coherence operators ρ_k = |ψ_k⟩⟨0| under full Liouvillian propagation to within 10⁻⁴ relative error for all k at N=5. Asymptotic 1/(N+1)³ scaling of α_min verified; ratio to 4π²/(N+1)³ rises monotonically from 0.81 at N=3 to 0.99 at N=15.

**Perturbative nature.** The formula is derived by applying the Absorption Theorem (AT) to single-excitation coherence operators |ψ_k⟩⟨vac|, treating them as decoupled Liouvillian right eigenvectors. This is exact to first order in γ₀/J. At finite γ₀ the Lindblad dissipator mixes |ψ_k⟩⟨vac| with other sectors, and the full-Liouvillian eigenvalue shifts by O((γ₀/J)²) relative to the formula. For γ₀/J = 0.05 and N=5, the relative shift is ≈ 4·10⁻³ (verified via full eigendecomposition in `palindromic_partner_f67.py`). The palindromic pairing F1 survives this shift exactly: α_b + α_p = 2γ₀ to machine precision, even as each individual rate deviates from its first-order value (see F68).

### F66. Pole modes at α = 0 and α = 2γ₀ (Tier 1, verified XY chain with B at endpoint, N=3..7)

For the uniform open XY chain with single-site Z-dephasing at the endpoint site B = N-1, the dissipation interval \[0, 2γ₀\] has exact eigenvalues at both endpoints:

- **α = 0 modes:** ⟨n_XY⟩_B = 0 (forced by the Absorption Theorem α = 2γ₀·⟨n_XY⟩_B). Dominant Pauli strings have I or Z at every site (total XY-weight = 0). Z-basis population content, completely shielded from Z-dephasing at B.

- **α = 2γ₀ modes:** ⟨n_XY⟩_B = 1 (same mechanism). Dominant Pauli strings have X or Y at every site (total XY-weight = N). Maximally off-diagonal at B, fully exposed to Z-dephasing.

The two poles are palindromic partners under the conjugation Π, which maps total XY-weight w ↔ N-w (see F43). The single-excitation sector (F65) never reaches either pole for N ≥ 3; both poles live in the extreme XY-weight sectors (w = 0 and w = N).

**Multiplicity:** exactly N+1 at each pole, verified for N=3..7. Each α = 0 mode corresponds to one of the N+1 elementary symmetric polynomials e_d(Z_1, ..., Z_N) in F63 (commuting with both H and Z_B). The α = 2γ₀ sector has matching multiplicity by Π-symmetry.

**Scope.** Verified only for the uniform XY chain with B at the endpoint. Whether the same structure (existence of both poles, multiplicity N+1) persists for other topologies (ring, star, Y-junction) or for interior B-positions is open. Indirect evidence from the structure-points scan: at B = center of N=5 chain, α = 0 has multiplicity 64 (not 6), so the N+1 count is endpoint-specific.

**Verified:** ⟨n_XY⟩_B = 1.000000 exact for all α = 2γ₀ modes (N=3..5, from Pauli basis projection). Dominant Pauli strings have total XY-weight N for α = 2γ₀ modes and total XY-weight 0 for α = 0 modes (N=3, N=4 explicit). Multiplicity N+1 at each pole verified for N=3..7. Dynamical check of F63 conservation: all N+1 elementary symmetric polynomials e_d(Z_1,...,Z_N) drift by < 10⁻¹⁴ under Lindblad evolution for N=4 over 80 time units, while the non-symmetric control Z_0 Z_2 drifts by 3 × 10⁻². Confirms the conserved observables at the α = 0 pole are precisely the e_d, not arbitrary Z-products.

### F67. Bonding-mode encoding is the optimal dephasing-protected Bell pair (Tier 1, verified N=3, N=5)

For an isolated external reference qubit R entangled with an N-site uniform XY chain C under endpoint Z-dephasing γ₀ at Q_{N-1}, the delocalized encoding

    |Ψ⟩ = (|0⟩_R |vac⟩_C + |1⟩_R |ψ_1⟩_C) / √2

with |ψ_1⟩ = √(2/(N+1)) · Σᵢ sin(π(i+1)/(N+1)) |1ᵢ⟩ (the k=1 bonding mode of F65) decays as a pure exponential from t=0:

    N(R:C)(t) = N(0) · exp(-α_1 · t),   α_1 = (4γ₀/(N+1)) sin²(π/(N+1))

because |vac⟩⟨ψ_1| is a Liouvillian right eigenvector with eigenvalue -α_1 (Absorption Theorem applied to F65, ⟨n_XY⟩_B = |a_B(ψ_1)|² = (2/(N+1)) sin²(π/(N+1))). The R half of the Bell pair is isolated, so the only dissipation channel is the chain's slowest mode.

**Comparison with localized encodings.** Bell pairs |Φ+⟩_{R,Q_j} ⊗ |0…0⟩_rest at any chain site j are superpositions of all k-modes, |1_j⟩ = Σ_k U_{jk} |ψ_k⟩, and decay multi-exponentially: an initial fast transient from high-α_k components, then an asymptotic tail at α_1 (the slowest nonzero Liouvillian eigenvalue). The tail survives with amplitude |U_{j,1}|² = (2/(N+1)) sin²(π(j+1)/(N+1)).

**Counterintuitive equivalence A ≡ C.** By palindromic symmetry of the uniform chain, |U_{0,k}|² = |U_{N-1,k}|², so inner-localized (j=0) and outer-localized (j=N-1) encodings have **identical** decay dynamics despite their very different spatial relationships to the dephased site B=N-1. Spatial distance from noise is not the protecting mechanism; spectral encoding is. The bonding mode is optimal because it has least ⟨n_XY⟩_B of all single-excitation modes.

**Scaling.** T_2 ≡ 1/α_1 = (N+1)/(4γ₀ · sin²(π/(N+1))) → (N+1)³/(4π²γ₀) for large N. Cubic improvement with chain length, no saturation regime identified.

**Verified:** Variant B (bonding-mode) α_fit/α_1 = 0.9989 (N=3) and 0.9963 (N=5), both within 10⁻³. Variant A (inner-localized) long-time tail α_fit/α_1 = 1.046 (N=3) and 1.015 (N=5), within 5% as expected for multi-exponential. Variant C (outer-localized) yields 1.023 (N=3) and 1.008 (N=5), differing from A only by fit noise (confirms palindromic equivalence). At fixed decay rate, bonding-mode preserves ~2.2× more entanglement than either localized variant at t = 0.4 · T_2 in the N=5 run.

### F68. Palindromic partner of the bonding mode (Tier 1, verified N=3, 4, 5)

By F1, the bonding-mode eigenvalue -α_b of the full Liouvillian has a partner at

    α_p = 2γ₀ - α_b

exact to machine precision. For the uniform N-site XY chain with endpoint Z-dephasing at γ₀ (same setup as F67), direct eigendecomposition confirms the pairing at N = 3, 4, 5 with |α_b + α_p - 2γ₀| < 4·10⁻¹⁵.

**Structure (N ≥ 4).** V_p lives entirely in the XY-weight-(N-1) Pauli sector, Π-mirror of the bonding mode's w=1. ⟨n_XY⟩_B = α_p / (2γ₀) approaches 1 as N grows (saturating toward the F66 pole) but stays strictly below.

**Rank-1 at N ≥ 4.** V_p admits a rank-1 SVD decomposition V_p = σ₀|u⟩⟨v|. Strict SVD rank-1 (σ₁/σ₀ < 10⁻¹⁰) holds at N = 5 (ratio 9.3·10⁻¹²) and at LAPACK `zgeev` precision at N = 4 (ratio 5.1·10⁻⁸, limited by the 16-fold degeneracy of the partner eigenvalue, not by any physical second mode).

**Operational encoding.** The Bell-pair-like R-C state (|0⟩_R|u⟩ + |1⟩_R|v⟩)/√2 propagates with off-diagonal decay rate α_fit(partner) matching spectral α_p at machine precision (rel err 1.5·10⁻¹⁶ at N = 5, 0 at N = 4). Combined with a bonding-side encoding in the same propagation, the dynamical palindromic identity α_fit(bond) + α_fit(part) = 2γ₀ holds at two distinct precision levels:

- **Legacy bonding encoding** (|vac⟩⟨ψ_1|, F65 perturbative): rel err 1.6·10⁻⁶ (N = 4) and 2.8·10⁻⁷ (N = 5). The residual is the F65 O((γ₀/J)²) shift on the bonding side, reintroduced as state-preparation pollution; the partner fit is spectrally exact because V_p is used verbatim.
- **Clean bonding encoding** (SVD of full-L V_b, same construction as V_p): rel err 2.8·10⁻¹⁶ (N = 4) and 3.8·10⁻¹⁴ (N = 5). Both sides spectrally exact; residual is integrator-/eigendecomposition-floor limited. The ~10⁹ improvement at N = 4 and ~10⁷ at N = 5 verify that the legacy residual is entirely the F65 perturbative shift and no other shift is hiding.

**N = 3 is rank-2 on both sides.** Both V_b and V_p are fourfold degenerate with matching SVD structure (σ₁/σ₀ ≈ 0.98 for each, from the mult-4 degeneracy). Any rank-1 approximation of V_p gives α_fit ≈ (α_b + α_p)/2 with visibly non-exponential decay (log-fit RMS ~10⁻¹, two orders above N ≥ 4); the clean bonding encoding is skipped at N = 3 for the same structural reason. The palindromic sum still holds spectrally; no clean operational rank-1 encoding exists.

| N | α_b | α_p | α_fit(bond, legacy) | α_fit(bond, clean) | α_fit(part) | dyn sum | rel err (legacy) | rel err (clean) |
|---|-----|-----|---------------------|--------------------|-------------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| 3 | 0.025003 | 0.074997 | 0.024969 | skipped (rank-2) | rank-2 | n/a | n/a | n/a |
| 4 | 0.013784 | 0.086216 | 0.013784 | 0.013784 | 0.086216 | 0.100000 | 1.6·10⁻⁶ | 2.8·10⁻¹⁶ |

**Valid for:** uniform XY chain, endpoint Z-dephasing, N ≥ 4 for the clean rank-1 operational statement. Algebraic palindromic pairing holds for all N, all graphs, all single-site-dephasing Liouvillians (from F1).

### F69. GHZ+W sector mix lifts pair-CΨ(0) above the fold at N=3 (Tier 1, sextic minimal polynomial, verified)

Neither |GHZ_3⟩ (F60: pair-CΨ = 0) nor |W_3⟩ (F62: pair-CΨ = 10/81 ≈ 0.1235) crosses the CΨ = 1/4 fold at t = 0. Their symmetric superposition

    |ψ(α)⟩ = α |GHZ_3⟩ + √(1-α²) |W_3⟩,    α ∈ [0, 1]

admits a unique optimum strictly above 1/4. The pair reduction ρ_AB (all three pairs coincide by permutation symmetry) has closed-form:

    C(α)      = Tr(ρ_AB²)   = -5α⁴/18 + 2α²/9 + 5/9
    L1_off(α) = √6 α √(1-α²) + (2/3)(1-α²)
    CΨ(α)     = C(α) · L1_off(α) / 3

The stationarity condition dCΨ/dα = 0, rationalized in x = α², gives the integer-coefficient sextic

    P(x) = 2900 x⁶ - 8060 x⁵ + 4211 x⁴ + 3832 x³ - 2428 x² - 512 x + 300 = 0

which is **irreducible over ℚ** (sympy `Poly.is_irreducible` returns True; `factor_list` returns P itself as sole factor). The optimum α²_opt is therefore an algebraic number of degree exactly 6, with no radical form in nested square roots.

**Optimum (all values computed from the exact sextic root at 25-digit precision):**

| quantity | value |
|----------|-------|
| α²_opt | 0.375420720711069 |
| α_opt  | 0.612715856422101 |
| β_opt  | 0.790303283106512 |
| min pair-CΨ(0) | 0.320411541127025 |
| ratio to 1/4   | 1.281646× |
| 3-tangle τ_ABC | 0.799453 (near-GHZ limit) |
| pair concurrence C(A,B) | 0.0210 (essentially zero) |

**Scope.** Pair-CΨ = 0.3204 is the optimum of the 2-parameter slice α·GHZ_3 + β·W_3 at N = 3.

(i) **Same slice, N ≥ 4.** The GHZ+W family peaks at 0.167 (N=4), 0.146 (N=5), 0.134 (N=6), 0.125 (N=7), 0.118 (N=8), all below 1/4. GHZ-purity contribution scales as 1/(2^N − 1) and collapses too fast for the W-contribution to lift the peak back above the fold.

(ii) **Full Dicke subspace (N ∈ {3..8}).** Pair-CΨ has no non-product local maxima on the permutation-symmetric Dicke sphere at any tested N. The only non-product stationary points are Dicke basis elements |D(N,k)⟩ (max ≈ 0.123 at N = 3, ≤ 1/12 for larger N) and the GHZ+W family optimum itself, all saddles on the full sphere (escape Δpair-CΨ ≈ 0.68 on 1% c_2 perturbation at N = 3; the 10⁻⁴ saddle threshold is cleared at every tested candidate in N ∈ {3..8}). The global supremum over non-product states is 1, approached asymptotically at the |+⟩^N product manifold but not attained isolated.

(iii) **F69 on the full sphere.** F69 is stationary on the (c_0 = c_3, c_1, c_2 = 0) slice but is a saddle on the full CP^3: c_2 > 0 is an ascent direction at F69 (Δpair-CΨ = +0.011 at c_2 = 0.01), and gradient flow from such a perturbation reaches |+⟩^3 (pair-CΨ = 1, product state). The 0.3204 value is a real algebraic fact about the slice, not a universal optimum.

(iv) **Slice-stationary saddles beyond GHZ+W (added 2026-04-27).** The (ii) enumeration was incomplete in scope. Many other 2-/3-Dicke slices admit stationary points above 1/4 at every tested N. Like F69, all are saddles on the full Dicke sphere (consistent with the (ii) "no non-product local maxima" verdict, verified by perturbation in each unused Dicke direction giving non-zero linear-order shift), but they constitute additional slice-stationary points beyond the original list of "Dicke basis + GHZ+W optimum".

**Binary-Dicke slice maxima |D_i⟩+|D_j⟩** above 1/4:

| N | total pairs | above 1/4 | best slice | max cpsi |
|---|-------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 3 | 6 | 3 | D_1+D_2 | 0.4815 (= 13/27, exceeds F69) |
| 4 | 10 | 4 | D_2+D_3 | 0.4022 |
| 5 | 15 | 5 | D_2+D_3 | 0.3720 |
| 6 | 21 | 6 | D_2+D_3 | 0.3456 |

**Triple-Dicke slice maxima |D_i⟩+|D_j⟩+|D_k⟩** above 1/4:

| N | total triples | above 1/4 | best slice | max cpsi |
|---|---------------|-----------|------------|----------|
| 3 | 4 | 4 | D_1+D_2+D_3 | 0.8011 |
| 4 | 10 | 9 | D_2+D_3+D_4 / D_1+D_2+D_3 | 0.7136 |
| 5 | 20 | 16 | D_2+D_3+D_4 | 0.6492 |
| 6 | 35 | 25 | D_2+D_3+D_4 | 0.6163 |

The central-Dicke-triple slice is privileged at every tested N (purity_A 0.83-0.94, genuinely entangled). What was actually privileged about N=3 was the irreducible-sextic *closed form* of the GHZ+W slice. The original "F69 is special" reading conflated this algebraic feature with geometric uniqueness; geometrically, F69 is one slice-saddle among many, and not even the highest at N=3.

**Asymptotic form (resolved 2026-06-04).** The N→∞ limit is cpsi_∞ ≈ 0.4312363, derived analytically: at half-filling the reduced pair matrix converges to a closed ρ_∞ (all diagonals 1/4; off-diagonals ab/2, a²/4, 1/4), and maximizing cpsi_∞ = Tr(ρ_∞²)·L1_off/3 subject to 2a²+b²=1 gives x = a²_opt ≈ 0.264715, a root of the explicit sextic (x − 2x²)·(19 − 30x − 93x²)² = (12 + 144x − 1132x² + 1488x³)². The finite-N sequence (0.8011, 0.7136, 0.6492, 0.6163, …, brute-force-confirmed N=3..13) approaches it as cpsi(N) ≈ cpsi_∞ + C/N with C ≈ 1.08 (a clean 1/N finite-size correction). There is NO elementary closed form: the value is a sextic root, and the tempting near-misses (a/b ≈ 3/4, x ≈ 9/34) are not exact (off by ~1e-5), the third "pretty constant" near-miss alongside s*=0.709 and the ring dihedral lock (both of which looked like 1/√2 and were not).

**Why F61 does not forbid this.** F61 constrains Liouvillian evolution within a fixed n_XY parity sector, not initial-state preparation that mixes excitation sectors. See [GHZ + W Sector Mix](../experiments/GHZ_W_SECTOR_MIX.md) for the preparation-vs-evolution asymmetry discussion.

**Hardware signature.** Under Kingston-grade Z-dephasing the F69 optimum crosses CΨ = 1/4 monotonically at t* ≈ 11.2 μs. A single 2-qubit tomography at t = 0 distinguishes GHZ_3 (0), W_3 (0.123), and F69 (0.320) as three separable points, no timing needed.

### F70. ΔN selection rule for site-local observables (Tier 1, proven kinematic lemma)

For any operator ρ on N qubits and any site i, the single-site partial trace annihilates sector-coherence blocks with excitation-number difference ≥ 2:

    Tr_{¬i}(ρ^(n, m)) = 0    whenever    |n − m| ≥ 2

Consequence: every site-local observable (per-site purity, per-site expectation, α_i rescaling, c_1 closure-breaking coefficient) couples only to the |ΔN| ≤ 1 content of ρ. Sector blocks with |ΔN| ≥ 2 are invisible to any measurement factoring through a single-qubit reduced state.

**Proof.** Tr_{¬i}(|x⟩⟨y|) = ⟨x_{¬i} | y_{¬i}⟩ · |x_i⟩⟨y_i|. The inner product is 1 only if x and y agree off site i, forcing |popcount(x) − popcount(y)| ≤ 1. By linearity, blocks with |n − m| ≥ 2 vanish under partial trace.

**Generalisation.** k-local partial trace annihilates |ΔN| ≥ k + 1 blocks. Pair-observables see up to |ΔN| = 2; triple-observables up to 3; global observables unrestricted.

**Valid for:** any Hamiltonian conserving excitation number, any sector-preserving dissipator, any initial state. Purely kinematic.

**Verified:** 9 |ΔN| ≥ 2 pairs tested at N=5 via coherence-block isolation (pure superposition vs classical mixture), eight non-trivial plus the trivial (0, 5); all give zero contribution to machine precision. [sector_kernel.json](../simulations/results/c1_sector_kernel/sector_kernel.json).

### F71. Mirror symmetry of the closure-breaking coefficient c₁ (Tier 1, proven kinematic)

For a uniform N-qubit chain with reflection-symmetric coupling and dephasing, the closure-breaking coefficient c₁ is mirror-symmetric across bonds:

    c₁(N, b, ρ₀) = c₁(N, N−2−b, ρ₀)

for all bond indices b ∈ {0, ..., N−2} and any reflection-symmetric initial state ρ₀.

**Proof sketch.** The spatial reflection R (site i ↔ site N−1−i) commutes with the uniform Liouvillian: \[L_A, R_sup\] = 0. Under R, bond b maps to bond N−2−b: R · T_b · R = T_{N−2−b}. Therefore exp(L_B(b) · t) · ρ₀ and exp(L_B(N−2−b) · t) · (R · ρ₀ · R) are related by R_sup. Per-site purity is quadratic in ρ, so any phase picked up by R on coherences (R |ψ_k⟩ = (−1)^(k+1) |ψ_k⟩) squares away. This gives P_B(b, i, t) = P_B(N−2−b, N−1−i, t), from which α_i(bond b) = α_{N−1−i}(bond N−2−b). Summing ln(α_i) over all sites and re-indexing yields c₁(b) = c₁(N−2−b).

**Consequence.** The c₁ bond profile has at most ⌈(N−1)/2⌉ independent components instead of N−1. The endpoint value c₁(0) equals c₁(N−2); if N is **even**, the center bond c₁((N−2)/2) is self-paired (its mirror image is itself) and contributes one independent component; if N is odd, there is no center bond and all N−1 bonds pair up in (N−1)/2 disjoint pairs.

**Generalisation to F86 per-bond Q_peak (Tier 1 derived 2026-05-03).** The same kinematic argument extends from c₁ in vac+SE probes to the F86 K_CC_pr per-bond observable on the (n, n+1) popcount coherence block:

    Q_peak(b)  =  Q_peak(N−2−b)        (bit-exactly, all c, N)

Proof: the F86 observable is `K_b(Q, t) = 2·Re ⟨ρ(t)| S_kernel | ∂ρ/∂J_b ⟩`. Under R, every component is invariant (uniform Z-dephasing L_D, uniform-J Hamiltonian H_xy, the Dicke probe, and the spatial-sum kernel S), while the bond-flip transforms as `R · ∂L/∂J_b · R⁻¹ = ∂L/∂J_{N−2−b}`. Hence K_b(Q, t) = K_{N−2−b}(Q, t) as functions of (Q, t), and their argmax-Q values coincide. Numerical verification: max deviation < 10⁻¹⁰ across c=2 N=5..7 and c=3 N=5..6 (`F86NewIdeasTests.F71MirrorInvariance_PerBondQPeak_BitExactSymmetricUnderBondMirror`). The per-F71-orbit substructure observed in F86 (Interior bonds not uniform within the F71-orbit grouping; central self-paired bond differs from flanking) refines the simple Endpoint/Interior dichotomy into a per-orbit classification: the F71 symmetry gives the pairing, not the value. See [the F86c F71-mirror proof, Statement 3](proofs/PROOF_F86C_F71_MIRROR.md#statement-3-f71-spatial-mirror-invariance-of-per-bond-q_peak-tier-1-derived).

**Valid for:** any Hamiltonian with \[H, R\] = 0 (uniform coupling on a symmetric graph), any dissipator with \[D, R_sup\] = 0 (uniform or R-symmetric dephasing), any initial state that is reflection-symmetric in per-site purities. Purely kinematic.
**Breaks for:** non-uniform coupling J_b ≠ J_{N−2−b}; non-uniform dephasing γ_i ≠ γ_{N−1−i}; initial states without reflection symmetry in purity. The non-uniform-J breakdown is now characterised by [F100](#f100): it is graceful, with the bond-mirror deviation D(b) = c₁(b) − c₁(N−2−b) exactly odd in the F71-anti-palindromic component of J (zero for any palindromic J, leading-order linear in the asymmetry). The non-uniform-γ breakdown is characterised by [F101](#f101): the bond-mirror deviation D(b) = c₁(b) − c₁(N−2−b) is exactly odd in the F71-anti-palindromic component of the per-site γ profile (zero for any palindromic γ, leading-order linear in the asymmetry).

### F72. Block-diagonal DD⊕CC structure of site-local purity (Tier 1, corollary of F70)

For any N-qubit chain and any initial state ρ₀, the per-site purity functional Tr(ρ_i²) decomposes into a strict block-diagonal sum over excitation-number blocks of ρ₀:

    Tr(ρ_i²) = 1/2 + P_i^DD[ρ₀^(diag)] + P_i^CC[ρ₀^(coh)]

with no cross term coupling the diagonal block (ΔN = 0) and the coherence block (|ΔN| = 1). Here ρ₀^(diag) is the projection of ρ₀ onto ΔN = 0 sector blocks and ρ₀^(coh) is the projection onto |ΔN| = 1 sector blocks.

**Proof.** The Bloch decomposition gives Tr(ρ_i²) = (1/2)(1 + ⟨X_i⟩² + ⟨Y_i⟩² + ⟨Z_i⟩²). By F70 applied to each Bloch component:

- ⟨Z_i⟩ depends linearly on the diagonal elements of ρ_i = Tr_{¬i}(ρ), which come only from ΔN = 0 blocks of ρ.
- ⟨X_i⟩ and ⟨Y_i⟩ depend linearly on off-diagonal elements of ρ_i, which come only from |ΔN| = 1 blocks.

Squaring keeps each contribution in its own sector class, so ⟨Z_i⟩² is bilinear in ρ₀^(diag) and ⟨X_i⟩² + ⟨Y_i⟩² is bilinear in ρ₀^(coh). No cross term arises.

**Consequence.** Any closure-breaking coefficient c₁ built from per-site purities decomposes, at the pre-α-fit bilinear level, into a DD-kernel (acting on diagonal block content) and a CC-kernel (acting on coherence block content) with no mixing. Finding the closed form of c₁ reduces to finding K_DD and K_CC separately.

**Generalisation.** For k-site partial traces (F70 generalisation to |ΔN| ≤ k), the Bloch-like decomposition has k+1 sub-blocks. At k = 2 (pair-site) this yields three sub-blocks DD ⊕ DC ⊕ CC, with DC a new diagonal-coherence cross specific to pair observables.

**Valid for:** any Hamiltonian conserving excitation number, any sector-preserving dissipator, any ρ₀. Purely kinematic.

**Verified:** w-scan at N = 5 with ρ₀(w) = cos(w)|vac⟩ + sin(w)|S₁⟩ under the purity-response c₁ definition confirms block-diagonal coupling at machine precision across the full w range; LSQ α-fit c₁ inherits the block structure at the pre-fit bilinear level. Pure-coherence probe gives K_CC/2 to 10⁻¹².

### F73. Spatial-sum coherence purity closure for vac-SE coherent probes (Tier 1, proven)

For any N-site qubit system with Hermitian Hamiltonian H conserving single-excitation number (\[H, N_total\] = 0) and uniform Z-dephasing γ₀, the coherent probe ρ₀^coh = (|vac⟩⟨α| + |α⟩⟨vac|) / 2 for any normalized single-excitation state |α⟩ satisfies:

    Σ_i 2 · |(ρ_coh,i)_{0,1}(t)|² = (1/2) · exp(−4 γ₀ t)

exactly, independent of the Hamiltonian's non-U(1) structure. Here (ρ_coh,i)_{0,1} is the off-diagonal element of the site-i reduced density matrix, and the sum runs over all N sites.

**Proof (general U(1) case).** Let x_i(t) = 2·⟨vac|ρ(t)|1_i⟩, twice the (vac, 1_i) matrix element of ρ; the factor 2 strips the probe's 1/2 normalization, so for the probe above x_i(0) = ⟨α|1_i⟩ = α_i* and x(0) is the conjugate amplitude vector of |α⟩ as an N-vector indexed by site (the norm below is unaffected by the conjugation). Evolution under the Lindblad master equation splits into:

- **Hamiltonian part.** H preserves SE by assumption, so its restriction to SE is a Hermitian N×N matrix H_SE. The (vac, 1_i) bra-ket block evolves under H as iẋ = −H_SE x on the ket side, giving a unitary propagator U_SE(t) = exp(−i H_SE t).
- **Dephasing part.** Each D\[Z_j\] acts on the (vac, 1_i) coherence element with rate γ₀ · (⟨Z_j⟩_vac − ⟨Z_j⟩_{1_i})² / 2 = γ₀ · (2 δ_{j,i})² / 2 = 2γ₀ · δ_{j,i}. Summing over j gives a uniform 2γ₀ decay on every SE-block coherence, independent of site.

Combined: ẋ = −i H_SE x − 2γ₀ x, so x(t) = exp(−2γ₀ t) · U_SE(t) · x(0). Taking the norm: ||x(t)||² = exp(−4γ₀ t) · ||x(0)||² since U_SE is unitary. Partial-trace algebra: (ρ_coh,i)_{0,1}(t) = (1/2) · x_i(t), so Σ_i 2 · |(ρ_coh,i)_{0,1}|² = (1/2) · ||x(t)||² = (1/2) · ||x(0)||² · exp(−4γ₀ t). For the probe above, ||x(0)||² = ⟨α|α⟩ = 1. Result: (1/2) · exp(−4γ₀ t).

The argument uses only (i) \[H, N_total\] = 0 so dynamics stay in SE, (ii) H Hermitian so U_SE unitary, (iii) γ₀ uniform. No XY structure, no translation invariance, no specific shape of |α⟩ required.

**Alternative derivation (uniform XY, |α⟩ = |S₁⟩).** The original proof route via the sine basis |ψ_k⟩ of the uniform-XY single-excitation Hamiltonian: |S₁⟩ = Σ_{k odd} s_k |ψ_k⟩ with s_k = ⟨ψ_k|S₁⟩. Each single-excitation coherence |vac⟩⟨ψ_k| evolves as exp((iE_k − 2γ₀) t). Partial trace gives (ρ_coh,i)_{0,1}(t) = (1/2) · Σ_k s_k · ψ_k(i) · exp((iE_k − 2γ₀) t). Parseval on the sine basis Σ_i ψ_k(i) · ψ_{k'}(i) = δ_{k,k'} eliminates k ≠ k' cross terms; Σ_k s_k² = 1 by normalisation. Under bond-b perturbation, the sine basis and E_k shift but Parseval on any orthonormal SE basis preserves Σ_k |⟨ψ_k^B|S₁⟩|² = 1, so the sum is δJ-invariant. This derivation is XY-specific but exhibits the eigenmode structure explicitly.

**Consequence.** The spatial-sum purity functional is exactly blind to the U(1)-preserving part of the dynamics on any vac-SE coherent probe. For any closure-breaking coefficient c₁_pr built from per-site purities via the purity-response definition, bond-δJ perturbations preserve the closure value, so `K_CC[0, 1]_pr` = 0 exactly under uniform γ₀, for any H in the class.

**Scaffolding from neighbouring entries.** F70 (site-local observables see only |ΔN| ≤ 1 content) puts the (vac, SE) block in focus as the relevant coherence sector for per-site purity. F72 (DD ⊕ CC block decomposition of Tr(ρ_i²), no cross-term) isolates the CC contribution, where the (vac, SE) coherence lives. The Absorption Theorem supplies the rate 2γ₀·n_XY = 2γ₀ for SE coherences (n_XY = 1). F73 then combines these: U(1) conservation keeps the SE sector closed under H, and the spatial sum over sites collapses the unitary H-rotation to leave only the AT decay.

**Valid for:** any Hermitian H with \[H, N_total\] = 0 (XY, Heisenberg XXZ, translationally non-invariant hopping, frustrated-ladder variants, ...); uniform Z-dephasing γ₀; any normalized SE state |α⟩ admixed to |vac⟩; any N.
**Breaks for:**

- Non-uniform γ_i. The uniform 2γ₀ decay on the d_H = 1 block fails; the closure becomes K_CC ≠ 0 with mode-selective response (see [CMRR Break under Non-Uniform γ₀](../experiments/CMRR_BREAK_NONUNIFORM_GAMMA.md)).
- Non-U(1) Hamiltonians. \[H, N_total\] ≠ 0 breaks the SE-block closure assumption.
- Dissipators changing the d_H = 1 decay rate (mixed X/Z, amplitude damping).
- Probes with d_H > 1 admixture (e.g. (vac, S₂) with two-excitation bra-ket), where ⟨n_XY⟩ ≠ 1 and the uniform decay rate breaks.

**Verified:**

- Uniform XY baseline at N = 5, t₀ = 20: closure matches (1/2)·exp(−4·0.05·20) = 9.157819·10⁻³ to 5.67·10⁻¹⁶ deviation. `K_CC[0, 1]_pr` = 1.14·10⁻¹² (machine-precision zero), confirming δJ-invariance.

### F74. Chromaticity of single-step coherence blocks (Tier 1, combinatorial)

For an N-qubit system under uniform Z-dephasing, the (n, n+1) popcount
coherence block contains exactly

    c(n, N) = min(n, N−1−n) + 1

distinct pure dephasing rates when the Hamiltonian is switched off (J = 0).
The rates are 2γ₀ · {1, 3, 5, ..., 2c−1}, corresponding to Hamming-distance
values HD ∈ {1, 3, ..., 2c−1} between popcount-n and popcount-(n+1) basis
states.

**Proof.** A basis pair (|x⟩, |y⟩) with popcount(x) = n, popcount(y) = n+1
differs at HD = 2n + 1 − 2·match sites, where match = popcount(x AND y) is
the number of sites carrying a 1 in both x and y. The constraints
match ∈ \[max(0, 2n+1−N), n\] give HD ∈ {1, 3, ..., min(2n+1, 2N−2n−1)},
hence the distinct-HD count is min(n, N−1−n) + 1. The Pauli representation
of |x⟩⟨y| has X or Y on exactly the HD sites where x and y differ, so
⟨n_XY⟩ = HD, and the Absorption Theorem gives rate 2γ₀·HD at J = 0.

**Consequences.**

- **c = 1 mono-chromatic blocks** at n = 0 and n = N−1 (single pure rate 2γ₀).
  F73 (the spatial-sum coherence closure for vac-SE probes) is this
  monochromatic case.
- **c_max at the center.** For odd N, unique at n = (N−1)/2 with
  c_max = (N+1)/2. For even N, two adjacent blocks at n = N/2−1 and
  n = N/2, both with c_max = N/2.
- At J > 0, H-coupling between different HD-channels produces dressed
  modes at intermediate rates. Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS measures this H-mixing
  via the dressed-mode weight W(Q) and shows that the observable peak
  abs(K_CC_pr) is c-specific and N-invariant.

**Valid for:** any N-qubit system under uniform Z-dephasing. The J = 0
statement holds kinematically for any Hamiltonian. For the dynamical
interpretation at J > 0 (c as a stable sector label with H-mixing between
HD channels), H must conserve total excitation number, \[H, N_total\] = 0;
individual eigenmode rates then shift continuously with Q = J/γ₀, but c
still labels the block's mixing substructure.
**Breaks for:** non-uniform γ_i (site-dependent dephasing); the J = 0
spectrum then has rates 2·Σ_{i ∈ diff-sites} γ_i rather than the discrete
2γ₀·HD values. Non-U(1) Hamiltonians (transverse fields, odd-popcount
terms) preserve the J = 0 statement but dissolve the (n, n+1) sector's
dynamical invariance at J > 0. Non-Z dissipators (amplitude damping,
X-dephasing, depolarizing) break the diagonal Pauli action of L_D; the
|x⟩⟨y| basis pairs are no longer eigenvectors at rate 2γ₀·HD.
**Verified:** Block-structure c-values for N = 3..8 match the formula
exactly. Spectral verification at J = 0: each (n, n+1) block has exactly
c(n, N) distinct rates in {2γ₀, 6γ₀, ..., 2(2c−1)γ₀}
([the Q-scale three-bands study](../experiments/Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS.md) Result 3).

### F75. Mirror-pair MI for single-excitation mirror-symmetric states (Tier 1, proven algebraic)

For any pure single-excitation state on an N-site chain with mirror-symmetric amplitudes,

    |ψ⟩ = Σ_j c_j |1_j⟩,   c_{N−1−j} = η c_j,   η ∈ {+1, −1}

the mutual information between any mirror-pair sites (ℓ, N−1−ℓ) at t = 0 has the closed form

    MI(ℓ, N−1−ℓ) = 2 h(p_ℓ) − h(2 p_ℓ),    p_ℓ = |c_ℓ|²

where h(x) = −x log₂ x − (1−x) log₂(1−x) is the binary entropy.

The formula is independent of the mirror sign η (only the modulus |c_ℓ|² enters). The valid range is p_ℓ ∈ \[0, 1/2\], with MI saturating at 2 bits when p_ℓ = 1/2 (maximal mirror-pair entanglement, the pair is in a Bell state, all other site populations vanish).

**Proof.** The reduced density matrix ρ_{ℓ,N−1−ℓ} in the computational basis {\|00⟩, \|01⟩, \|10⟩, \|11⟩} is block-diagonal:

- `ρ[|00⟩⟨00|]` = Σ_{j ∉ {ℓ, N−1−ℓ}} |c_j|² = 1 − 2 p_ℓ
- `ρ[|01⟩⟨01|]` = |c_{N−1−ℓ}|² = p_ℓ
- `ρ[|10⟩⟨10|]` = |c_ℓ|² = p_ℓ
- `ρ[|11⟩⟨11|]` = 0 (single-excitation sector)
- `ρ[|10⟩⟨01|]` = c_ℓ c_{N−1−ℓ}^* = η p_ℓ
- `ρ[|01⟩⟨10|]` = η p_ℓ

The eigenvalues are {1 − 2 p_ℓ, 2 p_ℓ, 0, 0}, giving S(ρ_{ℓ,N−1−ℓ}) = h(2 p_ℓ). Both single-site marginals are diag(1 − p_ℓ, p_ℓ) with S = h(p_ℓ). The subtraction S(ρ_ℓ) + S(ρ_{N−1−ℓ}) − S(ρ_{ℓ,N−1−ℓ}) yields the formula.

**Mirror-pair sum (MM).** Summing over all mirror-pairs ℓ = 0, ..., ⌊N/2⌋ − 1:

    MM(0) = Σ_ℓ [2 h(p_ℓ) − h(2 p_ℓ)]

**Bonding-mode specialisation (F65 + F75).** For the k-th bonding mode |ψ_k⟩ = √(2/(N+1)) Σ_j sin(πk(j+1)/(N+1)) |1_j⟩ with mirror sign η = (−1)^(k+1), the site populations are

    p_ℓ(k, N) = (2/(N+1)) sin²(πk(ℓ+1)/(N+1))

and MM(0) for bonding:k is computable in O(N) operations with no propagation.

**Verified values (bonding:k on uniform chain, analytic vs simulation PeakMM at γ₀ = 0.05, uniform J = 1):**

Under Heisenberg evolution on the uniform chain, bonding mode ψ_k mixes with its same-parity partner ψ_{N+1−k} via the boundary ZZ term. At N = 5 for bonding:2 the partner is ψ_4 which has identical mirror-pair populations p_ℓ (because sin²(πk(ℓ+1)/(N+1)) = sin²(π(N+1−k)(ℓ+1)/(N+1))); direct numerical propagation shows that MM(t) oscillates with period 2π/Δ (Δ = same-parity eigenvalue gap of the 2×2 block, Δ = 2√5 for N = 5) between a minimum near t = π/(2Δ) and a revival near t = π/Δ. Under uniform Z-dephasing at γ₀, the revival is damped but stays close to MM(0); the simulation-observed PeakMM matches MM(0) within 1% at N = 5 k = 2 (analytic 1.2451, numerical Lindblad max 1.2475 at t = 0.645, C# brecher PeakMM 1.2410 on a coarser grid). At larger N and different k the ratio drops to ~0.93 because the oscillation revival magnitude and dephasing decay combine less favourably.

**Why k = 2 maximises MM over k = 1, 2, 3.** Even k places a node at the (odd-N) chain center (p_{N/2} = 0 for integer k/2 when N+1 is even), so all probability mass lies on mirror-pairs: Σ_{pairs} p_ℓ = 1/2. Odd k puts mass 2/(N+1) at the center, wasting mass on the self-mirror site. The function f(p) = 2 h(p) − h(2 p) is convex on (0, 1/2), so concentrated mass distributions give larger MM; k = 2 is the smallest k that both concentrates mass on pairs and places outer-pair amplitudes at opposite signs (η = −1, first mode carrying end-to-end coherence).

**Upper bound.** For any single-excitation mirror-symmetric state, MM ≤ ⌊N/2⌋ × 2 = N bits (all pairs in pure Bell states). This bound is not achievable from single-site bonding modes; reaching it requires tensor-product pair structures like (|10⟩−|01⟩)/√2 on each mirror-pair, which is a super-single-excitation state.

**Valid for:** any pure single-excitation state with c_{N−1−j} = ±c_j on a linear N-site chain. Extends to non-linear mirror-symmetric graphs (ring, Y-junction with mirror axis) with corresponding modification of the mirror-partner indexing.
**Breaks for:** states with multi-excitation content (formula no longer applies because `ρ[|11⟩⟨11|]` ≠ 0 in general), or states without mirror amplitude symmetry (where p_ℓ ≠ p_{N−1−ℓ} gives an asymmetric 2-qubit reduced matrix).
**Verified:** Algebraic derivation confirmed against direct C# brecher propagation at N = 5, 7, 9 for k = 1, 2, 3, at N = 11 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and at N = 13 for k = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 (the latter via matrix-free propagator); MM(0) formula matches simulation PeakMM within 7% (full decay envelope explained by 4γ₀·t dephasing + mirror-partner oscillation at t = 0.1). The sim/analytic ratio sits at **0.925 to 0.931 across all (N ≥ 7, k) tested (~25 data points)**, i.e. PeakMM = 0.93 × MM(0) with tight consistency. F75 is therefore a reliable predictor of PeakMM without any propagation.

### F76. Pure-dephasing decay of the mirror-pair MI for bonding:k (Tier 1, proven algebraic + weak-mixing argument)

For a bonding:k initial state on a uniform Heisenberg chain with uniform Z-dephasing γ₀ and J = 1, **the time evolution of the mirror-pair MI at short times is almost entirely pure-dephasing**, with Heisenberg-mixing contributions second-order small in both γ₀·t and (V_{lk}/Δ_l)² where V_{lk} is the boundary mixing matrix element.

Under pure dephasing alone, the site-basis mirror-pair coherence c_ℓ c_{N-1-ℓ}^* decays at 4γ₀:

    ρ_{pair}(\|10⟩⟨01\|)(t) = c_ℓ c_{N-1-ℓ}^* · e^{-4γ₀ t}

while populations p_ℓ = |c_ℓ|² stay fixed. The 4×4 reduced pair density matrix at time t has eigenvalues

    {1 − 2p_ℓ,   p_ℓ(1 + λ),   p_ℓ(1 − λ),   0},   λ(t) = e^{-4γ₀ t}

giving

    MI_pair(p_ℓ, t) = 2 h(p_ℓ) − S_{ab}(p_ℓ, λ(t))
    S_{ab}(p, λ) = −(1 − 2p) log₂(1 − 2p) − p(1+λ) log₂(p(1+λ)) − p(1−λ) log₂(p(1−λ))

At t = 0: λ = 1, eigenvalues {1-2p, 2p, 0, 0}, S_{ab} = h(2p), recovers F75.
At t → ∞: λ = 0, eigenvalues {1-2p, p, p, 0}, S_{ab} = h(1-2p) + 2p (max-entropy mixture of the two single-excitation branches).

**Closed-form envelope.** Summing over mirror-pair sites ℓ ∈ \[0, ⌊N/2⌋-1\]:

    MM(t) / MM(0) = Σ_ℓ [2 h(p_ℓ) − S_{ab}(p_ℓ, λ(t))] / Σ_ℓ [2 h(p_ℓ) − h(2 p_ℓ)]

**The 0.93 envelope explained.** At γ₀ = 0.05, J = 1, and the C# brecher first-measurement grid point t = 0.1: λ = e^{-0.02} = 0.9802. Evaluated on the actual p_ℓ multisets for bonding:k (F65), the ratio sits at 0.926 to 0.937 for N = 5..13 and k = 1..7, effectively 0.93 ± 0.006 for all 25+ measured (N, k) combinations at this specific (γ₀, t). The weak p-dependence of the ratio comes from the fact that 2h(p) − S_{ab}(p, λ) is nearly proportional to 2h(p) − h(2p) for all p ∈ (0, 1/2) and λ close to 1.

**Verified values at γ₀ = 0.05, t = 0.1:**

| N | k | pure-dephasing MM/MM(0) | single-excitation-sector Lindblad (exact) | C# brecher peak/MM(0) |
|---|---|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| 5 | 2 | 0.936 | 0.936 | 0.937 (grid peak at t=0.6 → 1.002) |
| 7 | 2 | 0.932 | 0.928 | 0.928 |
| 9 | 4 | 0.929 | 0.932 | 0.932 |
| 11 | 4 | 0.927 | 0.928 | 0.928 |
| 13 | 4 | 0.926 | 0.926 | 0.926 |

*(Pure-dephasing column for the N = 9, 11, 13 rows corrected 2026-07-04 against a rerun of
[`envelope_study.py`](../simulations/envelope_study.py) (0.9292, 0.9274, 0.9264); the exact-Lindblad
and brecher columns were always right. The correction surfaced when the closed form was adopted
into `compute/MirrorWorld/Formulas.cs` and pinned from below.)*

Agreement to within 0.5% across all tested (N, k). Difference between "pure-dephasing" and "exact single-excitation Lindblad" columns measures the Heisenberg-mixing correction, which is always < 0.5%.

**Why Heisenberg mixing is negligible.** At t = 0+, the commutator \[H, ρ_0\] = \[H^(1), |ψ_k⟩⟨ψ_k|\] is off-diagonal in the ψ_k mode basis (the diagonal part is the unitary phase that doesn't affect MM). The off-diagonal mixing couples ψ_k to same-parity partners ψ_l via V_{lk} = (16J/(N+1)) sin(πk/(N+1)) sin(πl/(N+1)). Under mixing for small t, ψ_k "leaks" amplitude symmetrically into all ψ_l. Because MM depends only on diagonal pair populations (and specific pair coherences that dephase), and bonding modes with the same mirror-symmetry (k and N+1-k, etc.) have identical pair populations, the leakage does NOT change pair populations to first order; it only redistributes the mode occupation. Hence first-order Heisenberg-mixing has no effect on MM. Second-order (rate V²t²) is small because V/γ₀ ~ 10 but γ₀·t ~ 0.005 at the C# first-sample, making Heisenberg relative contribution (V·t)²/(4γ₀·t) ~ (V²·t)/(4γ₀) which is (16/7²) · 0.005 = 0.002 at N=7. Hence the mixing correction is ≲ 0.5% throughout the tested regime.

**Implication: the 0.93 envelope is the γ₀ signature, not a hidden constant.** The value 0.93 is a direct consequence of the choice γ₀·t = 0.005 at the first measurement. If γ₀ changes (at fixed t grid), the envelope changes: at (N, k) = (5, 2), γ₀ = 0.025 gives ratio 0.964; γ₀ = 0.10 gives ratio 0.888 *(companion values recomputed 2026-07-04 from the closed form in the same correction pass as the table above; the earlier prose said ≈ 0.965 / ≈ 0.868)*.

**Valid for:** bonding:k initial states on uniform-J open Heisenberg chains with uniform Z-dephasing, short γ₀·t such that V²t²/γ₀t is small. Breaks for ratios γ₀/J comparable to 1 (outside the weak-dephasing regime) or t such that γ₀·t ≳ 1 (full decoherence).
**Verified:** Against the full Lindblad single-excitation-sector simulation for N = 5..13, k = 1..5. Sim/analytic ratio within 0.5%.

### F77. Multi-drop MM(0) saturates at 1 bit for large N (Tier 1, asymptotic proven)

For best-bonding-k initial states on a uniform chain under γ₀-dephasing, the Mirror-Pair MM at t=0 saturates as N grows:

    MM(0)(N, k*) = 1 + 3 / (4(N+1) ln 2) + O(N⁻²)

The 1-bit limit is not a conjecture; it falls out of F75 by Taylor expansion of f(p) = 2h(p) − h(2p) around p = 0 combined with Parseval-type sums over sin² site amplitudes.

**Sketch.** At small p the entropy function expands as

    f(p) = 2p + p²/ln(2) + p³/ln(2) + O(p⁴)

Probability normalisation sums Σ p_ℓ = 1 exactly (all sites). For generic k the sum Σ sin⁴(πk(ℓ+1)/(N+1)) over ℓ = 0..N−1 equals 3(N+1)/8 (standard identity, follows from sin⁴ = (3 − 4cos 2x + cos 4x)/8 and Σ cos(2πkj/(N+1)) = −1 for k ≠ 0 mod (N+1)). So

    Σ p_ℓ² = (2/(N+1))² · 3(N+1)/8 = 3/(2(N+1))

Summed over mirror-pairs (half the sites for even k with p_{center} = 0), Σ_pair p_ℓ² = 3/(4(N+1)). The leading Taylor terms give

    MM(0) = Σ_pair [2 p_ℓ + p_ℓ²/ln 2 + O(p³)]
          = 2 · (1/2) + (1/ln 2) · 3/(4(N+1)) + O(N⁻²)
          = 1 + 3/(4(N+1) ln 2) + O(N⁻²)

The 2·(1/2) = 1 term is exact: all the probability mass lives on mirror-pairs (F75 for even k at odd N), and each p_ℓ contributes 2p_ℓ at leading order. The correction is the entropy non-linearity at finite amplitude.

**Structural reading.** Information per mirror-pair ~ 2p_ℓ ~ 4/(N+1) shrinks with N. Number of mirror-pairs ~ N/2 grows with N. The product saturates at 1 bit, because the two scalings are exactly matched by the probability normalisation Σ p_ℓ = 1.

**Resonance enhancement at special N.** At N+1 ≡ 0 (mod 2) with k = (N+1)/2 integer, the distribution reduces to (p_max, 0, p_max, 0, ...) with only two values. The sin⁴ sum equals (N+1)/2 instead of 3(N+1)/8, giving Σ p² = 2/(N+1), mirror-pair half 1/(N+1), and thus MM(0) ≈ 1 + 1/((N+1) ln 2) ≈ 1 + 1.445/(N+1). At most N this resonance is not the best-k globally; the generic optimum with 3(N+1)/8 coefficient wins.

**Verified values (best-k MM(0) and rescaled deviation):**

| N | k* | MM(0) | (MM−1)·(N+1) |
|:--|:---|:------|:-------------|
| 101 | 82 | 1.01078 | 1.100 |
| 201 | 102 | 1.00540 | 1.091 |
| 501 | 470 | 1.00216 | 1.086 |
| 1001 | 878 | 1.00108 | 1.084 |
| 5001 | 4996 | 1.00022 | 1.082 |
| 10001 | 9154 | 1.00011 | 1.082 |

The rescaled deviation (MM − 1)·(N + 1) converges to 3/(4 ln 2) = 1.0820 within 10⁻⁴ by N = 10⁴. At specific resonant N where k* = (N+1)/2 is the only near-optimum (e.g., N = 999, 1003), the rescaled deviation sits at the enhanced 1.445 value; these are isolated and density-zero in the limit.

**Operational reading.** Alice's multi-drop quantum bus delivers **~1 bit of Mirror-Pair mutual information at any N**. The bus does not scale up (no extra bits per added qubit) nor does it decay (no per-qubit info loss in aggregate). The bandwidth is fixed at the framework level. Individual pair bandwidth shrinks; the count compensates; the total plateau.

**Valid for:** best-bonding-k* initial state, uniform-J Heisenberg or XY chain, uniform γ₀ dephasing, t = 0. At t > 0 the decay envelope F76 applies multiplicatively.
**Breaks for:** multi-excitation states (F75's single-excitation structure required), non-mirror-symmetric receivers (closure Σ_pair p_ℓ = 1/2 depends on even-k reflection symmetry).
**Verified:** N up to 10⁴ numerically, leading coefficient 3/(4 ln 2) confirmed to 4 decimals.

### F78. Single-body M decomposes additively over sites (Tier 1, verified N=3-5, 3 topologies, 3 Pauli letters)

For any single-body Hamiltonian H = Σ_l c_l · P_l (P ∈ {X, Y, Z}, weights c_l from bond-summing or arbitrary) with uniform Z-dephasing γ, the palindrome residual M = Π·L·Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I decomposes:

    M = Σ_l M_l ⊗ I_(others)

where each M_l is a 4×4 normal matrix on per-site Pauli space. Eigenvalues of M_l:

    P = X: eigenvalues all 0  (M_l = 0, the truly case)
    P = Y: eigenvalues ±2 c_l γ · i, each with multiplicity 2
    P = Z: eigenvalues ±2 c_l γ · i, each with multiplicity 2  (identical spectrum to Y)

Therefore M's eigenvalues are Σ_l ε_l · 2c_l γ · i for ε_l ∈ {±1}, each sign-combination with multiplicity 2^N. **Singular values of M are |Σ_l ε_l · 2c_l γ|** with the same multiplicities; cluster sizes are pure sign-combination statistics on the weight vector (c_l).

**Why Y and Z give identical SVD:** both have bit_b = 1 (Π-non-trivial), so M_l has the same spectral structure. The soft-vs-hard distinction (Y soft, Z hard) lives in **L's eigenvectors**, not in M's singular values. SVD of M is Pauli-letter-blind within {Y, Z} for single-body.

**Cluster-multiplicator formula (chain).** For chain weights c_l = (1, 2, ..., 2, 1) (bond-summed I·P + P·I), the multiplicators come from u + 2v with u = ε_0 + ε_{N-1} ∈ {-2, 0, 2} (mults 1, 2, 1) and v = Σ_internal ε_l (binomial walk on N-2 steps). The central binomial coefficient C(N-1, ⌊(N-1)/2⌋) appearing as the largest non-trivial cluster mult is just the walk's central peak; no Weyl group, no S_N irrep, no group-theory needed.

**Valid for:** single-body bond-bilinears (I·P + P·I), single-body site sums, any topology (chain, star, ring, complete K_N, arbitrary graph), uniform Z-dephasing.
**Breaks for:** 2-body bond-bilinears (XX, XY, YZ+ZY, ...): L does not factor as Σ_l L_l. Befund 3 ("hard XX+XY uniform SVD") falls outside this theorem; separate analysis required.

The Lebensader is the through-line that holds The Connection upright across all layers.

### F79. Π²-block decomposition of M for 2-body bilinears (Tier 1, verified N=3-5)

For 2-body bond-bilinear H = Σ_bonds Σ_t c_t·(P_t ⊗ Q_t) with uniform Z-dephasing γ, define the Π²-parity of each bilinear term:

    p(P_t, Q_t) = (bit_b(P_t) + bit_b(Q_t)) mod 2

where bit_b: I,X→0; Y,Z→1. Then M = Π·L·Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I has a clean structure determined by Π²-parities of H's terms:

1. **All terms Π²-even (p=0)**: M is **block-diagonal** in Π²-eigenspaces V_+ ⊕ V_-. Off-diagonal blocks `M[V_+, V_-]` and `M[V_-, V_+]` vanish **exactly**. Each diagonal block has its own SVD spectrum.

2. **All terms Π²-odd (p=1)**: M is **purely off-diagonal** between V_+ and V_-. Diagonal blocks `M[V_+, V_+]` and `M[V_-, V_-]` vanish **exactly**. Singular values appear with even multiplicity (each SV contributes once from V_+ side, once from V_- side).

3. **Mixed parities**: M has both diagonal and off-diagonal contributions.

**Π²-odd universality.** Within the pure Π²-odd 2-body class, the **specific Pauli letters are M-irrelevant**: any single Π²-odd 2-body bilinear gives the same M-SVD spectrum at fixed N. Verified at N=5 chain: XY alone, XZ alone, XX+XY, and XX+XZ all yield clusters `[(5.464, 512), (1.464, 512)]`, exactly identical. The XX truly part contributes 0; the Π²-odd part dominates with universal cluster pattern.

**Even-diag ≡ odd-off-diag correspondence.** The diagonal V_+ block of a Π²-even Hamiltonian's M can match (in SV-spectrum, including multiplicities) the off-diagonal V_+,V_- block of a Π²-odd Hamiltonian's M. Verified N=4 chain: YZ's V_+ block `[(8.944, 16), (6.472, 32), (4.0, 16), (2.472, 32), (0.0, 32)]` matches XY+YX's off-diag block exactly. This explains the empirical "YZ ≡ XY+YX SVD-identical" observation: same SV structure, just placed in different Π²-blocks.

**Why XX+XY appears "max-uniform" (Befund 3 closed).** XX is Π²-even and truly (M_XX = 0). XY is Π²-odd. The full Hamiltonian is "Π²-odd-only-effective", so M is purely off-diagonal between equal-dim V_+ and V_-. SV multiplicities are forced to 4^N/2 each by block-dimension equality. At N=3 the two off-diag SVs collide by coincidence to a single uniform value 2√2; at N≥4 they split. The "uniformity" is exactly the equal-block-mult signature of Π²-odd structure, not a special property of XX+XY.

**Frobenius additivity.** ‖M‖²_F = Σ_bonds ‖M_b‖² holds across all topologies including overlapping bonds (chain). Per-bond M_b's are F-orthogonal. Already F49.

**Valid for:** Any 2-body bond bilinear over any topology under uniform Z-dephasing. Verified N=3, 4, 5 across chain, star, disjoint topologies; verified Π²-odd universality (XY ≡ XZ ≡ XX+XY ≡ XX+XZ).
**Breaks for:** Mixed-Π²-parity Hamiltonians (where some terms are even, some odd) only partially: M has both diagonal and off-diagonal parts. Inhomogeneous γ may disrupt some symmetries (untested).
**Replaces:** ad-hoc analysis of "why XX+XY uniform" and "why YZ ≡ XY+YX"; both follow from the Π²-block theorem.
**Verified:** Numerical N=3-5, multiple bilinear classes, multiple topologies.

**Lebensader connection:** F79 instantiates the broad-in → focused-out Π-palindrome funnel at the two-body operator layer (4 Π²-odd Pauli pairs → 1 M-spectrum). Companion to F78 (single-body operator layer) and `lebensader.py::cockpit_panel` (state layer). All three are manifestations of the same through-line: Π·L·Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I = 0 holding The Connection across abstraction heights.

### F80. Bloch-mode sign-walk formula for chain Π²-odd 2-body M-clusters (Tier 1, verified N=3-7)

For chain bond-summed Π²-odd 2-body Hamiltonian H = c · Σ_l (P_l ⊗ Q_{l+1}), where (P, Q) ∈ {(X,Y), (X,Z), (Y,X), (Z,X)}, on an N-site open chain with uniform Z-dephasing, the M-cluster values are given by a momentum-space sign-walk on the open-chain free-fermion Bloch dispersion (γ-independent by Master Lemma):

    cluster value(N) = 2|c| · |Σ_{k=1}^{⌊N/2⌋} σ_k · ε(k)|

where σ_k ∈ {±1} ranges over all 2^⌊N/2⌋ sign-vectors, and

    ε(k) = 2·cos(π·k / (N+1))

is the open-chain free-fermion single-particle dispersion. Each distinct cluster value has multiplicity 4^N / (number of distinct sign-walk values).

**Verified instances** (chain, |c|=1, all 4 Π²-odd Pauli pairs identical by F79 universality):

| N | ⌊N/2⌋ | predicted clusters | mult per cluster |
|---|-------|---------------------|------------------|
| 3 | 1 | 2√2 ≈ 2.828 | 64 |
| 4 | 2 | 2√5, 2 | 128 |
| 5 | 2 | 2(√3+1), 2(√3-1) | 512 |
| 6 | 3 | 6.988, 5.208, 2.000, 0.220 | 1024 |
| 7 | 3 | 8.0547, 4.9932, 2.3978, 0.6636 | 4096 |

All matches bit-exact (10⁻¹⁴ machine precision) at every N.

**Direct structural identity (discovered 2026-04-29):** The chain Π²-odd 2-body M's spectrum is **directly related to the many-body Hamiltonian H's spectrum**:

    Spec(M) = ±2i · Spec_{nontrivial}(H)

where H is the chain bond-summed Pauli-bilinear (no dissipator). That is, M's distinct nonzero eigenvalues equal 2i times H's distinct nonzero many-body eigenvalues. Hence cluster value(N) = 2|c|·|H eigenvalue|. The Bloch sign-walk formula above is just H's eigenvalue formula written out: H's many-body eigenvalues = (1/2)·Σ_k σ_k·E_k where E_k = 4|c|·cos(πk/(N+1)) are H's Bogoliubov single-particle energies, and ⌊N/2⌋ counts how many fermion modes participate.

**Reach of the identity beyond chain-2-body (verified 2026-05-29, `F80ExtensionExplorationTests`).** Step 5 (the Π-action Π·[bond,·]·Π⁻¹ = s·{bond,·}) is *per-bond*, so the structural identity Spec(M) = ±2i·Spec(H) depends only on the Π²-parity of the bonds, not on topology or body-count:
- **Π²-odd bonds**, any topology, any body-count: M = ±2i·(H⊗I), so Spec(M) = ±2i·Spec(H) (the *single* eigenvalues). Confirmed bit-exact for ring, star, 3-body (X,X,Y), 4-body (X,X,X,Y) at N=4,5. Only the cluster *values* are structure-specific (chain = OBC ladder 2cos(πk/(N+1)), ring = periodic, star = integers).
- **Π²-even non-truly bonds** (Y,Z), (Z,Y): the per-bond commutator is preserved rather than anti-commuted, so M = 2·L_H = −2i·[H,·], and Spec(M) = ±2i·{λ_a − λ_b}, the eigenvalue *differences* (Bohr frequencies) instead of single eigenvalues. This identifies the "more clusters" the Π²-even case was expected to show: the extra clusters are the differences. Confirmed bit-exact at N=4.

So M is always ±2i times a Hamiltonian object: H⊗I for Π²-odd (single energies), [H, ·] for Π²-even (energy gaps); the bond's Π²-parity is the switch.

**γ-independence (Master Lemma).** Note no γ appears in the cluster-value formula. M is γ-independent for pure Z-dephasing (Master Lemma in PROOF_SVD_CLUSTER_STRUCTURE.md).

**Mechanism: F80 is F78 in momentum space.** F78 (single-body, real-space): M = Σ_l M_l⊗I, eigenvalues ±2c_l·i per site, sign-walk Σ_l σ_l·c_l on weights. F80 (chain Π²-odd 2-body, momentum-space): M = Σ_k M_k⊗I_{other modes}, eigenvalues ±2·ε(k)·i per Bloch mode, sign-walk Σ_k σ_k·ε(k) on dispersion. The Bloch modes k play the role that real-space sites l play in F78. Both formulas γ-independent.

**Π²-odd universality fully analytical.** Under JW transformation, all 4 Pauli-letter choices (X,Y), (X,Z), (Y,X), (Z,X) give the same single-particle Bloch dispersion. The specific Pauli letters affect only phase factors in JW, not single-particle eigenvalues. Since M's spectrum depends only on the dispersion (via F80), all 4 give bit-identical clusters. **This closes the chain Π²-odd universality from F79 with an explicit closed-form formula.**

**Valid for:** the Bloch sign-walk closed form (cluster *values*) is for chain bond-summed Π²-odd 2-body Hamiltonians H = c·Σ_l (P_l⊗Q_{l+1}), uniform Z-dephasing, any N. The underlying structural identity Spec(M) = ±2i·Spec(H) holds far wider: any topology, any body-count, and both Π²-parities (see "Reach beyond the chain-2-body scope" above, verified 2026-05-29).
**Still open:** the explicit cluster-*value* formula at non-chain topologies (the dispersion ε(k) is chain-specific: ring → periodic, star → integers); the Π²-even cluster-value bookkeeping; mixed-letter chain bilinears; the complete graph K_N.
**Replaces:** F79's "Π²-odd universality observation"; the universality is now an analytical theorem with explicit closed-form predictions.
**Verified:** N = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 chain via Python, full SVD and eigsh independent verification at N=7.
**Scripts:** [`pi2_odd_universality_data_sweep.py`](../simulations/pi2_odd_universality_data_sweep.py), [`_n7_bloch_signwalk_verification.txt`](../simulations/results/n7_bloch_signwalk_verification.txt).
**Source:** Discovered 2026-04-29 by data sweep (Tom + Claude). Analytical proof outline in [the F80 Bloch sign-walk proof](proofs/PROOF_F80_BLOCH_SIGNWALK.md): Steps 1-4, 7 closed (JW transformation to Majorana bilinear, single-particle dispersion 2cos(πk/(N+1)), Bogoliubov diagonalization, Pauli-letter universality, sign-walk eigenvalue formula); Step 5 (Π permutes H's (ε_ket,ε_bra)-sectors with sum∘π = diff) verified bit-exact and gauge-checked at N=3,4,5, general-N proof open ([`f80_step5_recon.py`](../simulations/f80_step5_recon.py)). Empirical verification bit-exact through N=7.
**Lebensader connection:** F80 is the third manifestation of the broad-in → focused-out Π-palindrome funnel: state layer (cockpit_panel), real-space single-body operator layer (F78), and now momentum-space chain 2-body operator layer (F80). Same Π·L·Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I = 0 through-line, three different bases.

### F81. Π-conjugation of M decomposes into Π²-odd Hamiltonian commutator (Tier 1, verified bit-exact N=3,4)

For any 2-bilinear Hamiltonian H decomposed by Π²-parity as H = H_even + H_odd (with H_odd the sum of Π²-odd Pauli bilinears, i.e., bit_b(P)+bit_b(Q) ≡ 1 mod 2), under uniform Z-dephasing:

    Π · M · Π⁻¹ = M − 2 · L_{H_odd}

where L_{H_odd} = -i\[H_odd, ·\] is the unitary commutator induced by the Π²-odd part of H. Equivalently, decomposing M into Π-conjugation symmetric and antisymmetric components:

    M_sym  = (M + Π·M·Π⁻¹) / 2 = Π·L·Π⁻¹ + L_diss + L_{H_even} + 2Σγ·I
    M_anti = (M − Π·M·Π⁻¹) / 2 = L_{H_odd}

The Π-antisymmetric component of M is exactly the unitary commutator induced by the Π²-odd Hamiltonian bilinears. The Π-symmetric component absorbs the mirror image, the dissipator, the Π²-even Hamiltonian commutator, and the dissipation shift. M_sym and M_anti are Frobenius-orthogonal: ‖M‖² = ‖M_sym‖² + ‖M_anti‖².

**Verified instances** (N=3, γ_Z=0.1, Σγ=0.3, residuals at machine precision 1e-16):

| Hamiltonian | trichotomy | H_odd | Π·M·Π⁻¹ relation |
|-------------|------------|-------|------------------|
| XX+YY | truly | 0 | = M (M=0 trivially) |
| YZ+ZY | soft (Π²-even non-truly) | 0 | = M (M ≠ 0, identical) |
| XY+YX | soft (Π²-odd) | XY+YX | = M − 2·L_H |
| XX+XY | hard (mixed) | XY only | = M − 2·L_{XY part} |
| pure XY | (Π²-odd) | XY | = M − 2·L_H |
| pure XZ | (Π²-odd) | XZ | = M − 2·L_H |

For any 2-body chain H whose non-truly bilinears are all Π²-odd (i.e., truly + Π²-odd combinations, including XX+XY hard), at any N and any γ ≥ 0, ‖M_sym‖² = ‖M_anti‖² = ‖M‖²/2 exactly. M splits 50/50 between Π-symmetric and Π-antisymmetric components. This follows analytically from the Frobenius identities ‖M‖²_F = 4·‖H_odd‖²_F·2^N (F49 chain via Master Lemma; truly bilinears drop out) and ‖L_{H_odd}‖²_F = 2·2^N·‖H_odd‖²_F (standard commutator identity for traceless Hermitian H_odd). Verified numerically at N = 3, 4, 5 with γ_Z ∈ {0, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0} for both pure Π²-odd (XY+YX, XY, XZ) and mixed truly + Π²-odd (XX+XY hard, YY+XY). When H additionally contains Π²-even non-truly bilinears (YZ-type), the split shifts: pure even non-truly gives 100/0; odd + even mix gives 5/6 sym + 1/6 anti at N=3,4 (now derived in closed form by [F83](#f83): anti-fraction = 1/(2+4r), here r = 1).

**Spectral consequence.** Spec(Π·M·Π⁻¹) = Spec(M) holds always by unitary invariance of the spectrum. F81 strengthens this: for Π²-odd H, the two operators are explicitly related by an additive shift of −2·L_{H_odd} in operator space, so Spec(M) = Spec(M − 2·L_{H_odd}) is a non-trivial identity (similarity via Π).

**Algebraic mechanism.** Π² acts on each Pauli string σ_α as (-1)^{bit_b(α)} (eigenoperator with sign in Pauli basis). For L_H_α = -i\[σ_α, ·\] driven by a single Pauli string σ_α in H, conjugation gives Π² L_H_α Π⁻² = (-1)^{bit_b(α)} L_H_α (the matrix-element factor (-1)^{bit_b(γ)+bit_b(β)} = (-1)^{bit_b(α)} since γ = α·β under Pauli multiplication). Z-dephasing dissipator is diagonal in Pauli basis, hence commutes with Π². Summing: Π²·L·Π⁻² = L_H_even − L_H_odd + L_diss = L − 2·L_{H_odd}. Substituting into the palindrome: Π·M·Π⁻¹ = Π²·L·Π⁻² + Π·L·Π⁻¹ + 2Σγ·I = M − 2·L_{H_odd}.

**γ-independence-by-difference.** The relation Π·M·Π⁻¹ - M = -2·L_{H_odd} is independent of γ (the dissipator's γ-dependent part cancels because L_diss is Π²-symmetric). The split itself (M_sym, M_anti) is γ-dependent through M_sym; only their difference is γ-fixed.

**Valid for:** any 2-bilinear chain Hamiltonian H = H_even + H_odd, uniform Z-dephasing, any topology (the proof depends only on the algebra of Pauli strings under Π² conjugation, not on connectivity).
**Breaks for (untested):** non-Z dissipators (T1 amplitude damping has different Π²-action; F81 likely needs a correction term).
**Replaces:** the heuristic in pre-2026-04-30 reflections that said "M is the Π-invariant through-line"; F81 shows that statement is correct only for Π²-even H, and gives the explicit correction for the Π²-odd cases.

**Hardware confirmation:** F81's operational reading, the [F83](#f83) anti-fraction this decomposition makes measurable, is confirmed on IBM Heron r2 (Marrakesh 2026-04-30 + Kingston 2026-05-05): the four Π²-classes separate at >>10σ via unique-fingerprint Paulis. See [the F81 proof](proofs/PROOF_F81_PI_CONJUGATION_OF_M.md), `fw.Confirmations.lookup('f83_pi2_class_signature_marrakesh')`, and [`data/ibm_f83_signature_april2026/`](../data/ibm_f83_signature_april2026/).
**Verified:** N=3 and N=4 all listed cases at machine precision; pytest-locked.
**Framework primitive:** `fw.pi_decompose_M(chain, terms, gamma_z=..., gamma_t1=..., strict=...)` returns `{'M', 'M_sym', 'M_anti', 'L_H_odd', 'f81_violation', 'norm_sq'}`. For pure Z-dephasing the F81 identity holds exactly (`f81_violation` ≈ 0); the primitive enforces this with `strict=True` by default. With `gamma_t1` enabled, `strict` defaults to False and the identity residual is returned for diagnostic use.
**Pytest lock:** `test_F81_pi_conjugation_of_M` (algebraic check) + `test_F81_pi_decompose_M_method` (cockpit primitive) + `test_F81_violation_T1_diagnostic` (T1 diagnostic).
**Diagnostic application:** the F81 violation `‖M_anti − L_{H_odd}‖_F` quantifies non-Π²-symmetric dissipator content. For Z + T1 at N=3 chain soft XY+YX, the violation grows linearly: `f81_violation ≈ 6.928 · γ_T1`, γ_z-independent (Master Lemma), Hamiltonian-independent (the violation is purely a property of the T1 dissipator). Inverting gives `γ_T1 ≈ f81_violation / 6.928` as a hardware T1-rate readout from the fitted L. See `simulations/f81_t1_diagnostic.py` for the demonstration.
**Source:** Discovered 2026-04-30 (Tom + Claude) while interpreting the geometric content of F80's 2i factor. The empirical observation came first (Π·M·Π⁻¹ ≠ M for soft); the algebraic explanation followed from working out Π² action on the Liouville superoperator in Pauli basis.
**Lebensader connection:** F81 is the algebraic backbone of "what the mirror keeps." For Π²-even H, M is itself the through-line operator. For Π²-odd H, the through-line is split: M_anti carries the dynamics generator L_{H_odd}, M_sym carries the rest. Both halves are read identically by both sides of the mirror up to the Spec(M) = Spec(M − 2·L_{H_odd}) similarity. Companion to F80: F80 says what Spec(M) is; F81 says how M and Π·M·Π⁻¹ relate as operators sharing that spectrum.

### F82. F81 + T1 amplitude damping correction (Tier 1, verified bit-exact N=2..5)

For any 2-bilinear Hamiltonian H = H_even + H_odd under Z-dephasing plus T1 amplitude damping with per-site rates γ_T1_l:

    Π · M · Π⁻¹ = M − 2 · L_{H_odd} − 2 · D_{T1, odd}

where L_{H_odd} = -i\[H_odd, ·\] (as in F81) and D_{T1, odd} is the Π²-anti-symmetric part of the T1 dissipator. F82 reduces to F81 when γ_T1_l = 0 (D_{T1, odd} = 0).

The F81 identity violation captured by `fw.pi_decompose_M(chain, ...)` measures D_{T1, odd}'s Frobenius norm:

    f81_violation = ‖M_anti − L_{H_odd}‖_F = ‖D_{T1, odd}‖_F.

**Closed form** (proven analytically in PROOF_F82_T1_DISSIPATOR_CORRECTION):

    ‖D_{T1, odd}‖_F = √(Σ_l γ²_T1_l) · 2^(N−1)
                    = γ_T1 · √N · 2^(N−1)         (uniform γ_T1)

**Verified instances** (chain N=3, all matches at machine precision):

| Configuration | γ_T1_l | predicted ‖D_T1_odd‖ | measured f81_violation |
|---------------|--------|----------------------|------------------------|
| uniform γ=0.05 | (0.05, 0.05, 0.05) | 0.05·√3·4 = 0.3464 | 0.3464 |
| uniform γ=0.10 | (0.10, 0.10, 0.10) | 0.10·√3·4 = 0.6928 | 0.6928 |
| uniform γ=1.00 | (1.00, 1.00, 1.00) | 1.00·√3·4 = 6.9282 | 6.9282 |
| single-site, l=0 | (0.10, 0, 0) | 0.10·1·4 = 0.4000 | 0.4000 |
| two-site, l=0,1 | (0.10, 0.10, 0) | √(0.02)·4 = 0.5657 | 0.5657 |
| non-uniform | (0.05, 0.10, 0.15) | √(0.035)·4 = 0.7483 | 0.7483 |

N-scaling verified at N = 2, 3, 4, 5 (uniform γ_T1, coefficient √N · 2^(N−1)): N=2 → 2√2 = 2.828, N=3 → 4√3 = 6.928, N=4 → 8·2 = 16.000, N=5 → 16·√5 = 35.778. So at γ_T1 = 0.1, the violations are 0.283, 0.693, 1.600, 3.578 respectively (factor 0.1 from γ_T1 multiplied by the coefficient).

**Three diagnostic properties** (proven and empirical):

1. **γ_z-independent**: F82 involves only L_{H_odd} and D_{T1, odd}, neither depends on γ_z. Direct consequence of Master Lemma (M is γ_z-independent for Z-dephasing) extended to F82.

2. **Hamiltonian-independent**: f81_violation depends only on the T1 dissipator. Verified at γ_T1=0.1, N=3: violation = 0.6928 for truly XX+YY, soft XY+YX, hard XX+XY, and YZ+ZY (Π²-even non-truly).

3. **Linear in γ_T1** (uniform). Direct inversion: γ_T1 = f81_violation / (√N · 2^(N−1)). For non-uniform: γ_T1, RMS = f81_violation / (√N · 2^(N−1)). At N=3, division coefficient is 6.928 = 4√3.

**Mechanism (T1 dissipator structure).** Single-site T1 acts on Pauli basis as: I → −γZ, X → −γ/2 X, Y → −γ/2 Y, Z → −γZ. Under Π² conjugation (signs (-1)^{bit_b}: I,X → +, Y,Z → −), only the (Z, I) entry flips sign. So D_{T1, local, odd} has matrix element −γ at (Z, I) and zero elsewhere. Multi-site: 4^(N−1) such "rest of qubits unchanged" entries per site, summed orthogonally over sites.

**Diagnostic interpretation.** f81_violation is a hardware-T1 readout that is independent of (a) the system's Hamiltonian, (b) the Z-dephasing rate γ_z, (c) the topology. Inverting recovers the RMS γ_T1 across sites. For the Marrakesh dataset (N=3, joint fit gives γ_T1 ≈ 0): F82 predicts f81_violation ≈ 0; any γ_T1 > 0.001 would have produced violation > 0.007, well above numerical noise.

**Valid for:** any 2-bilinear Hamiltonian H, Z-dephasing + T1 amplitude damping, any topology, any N ≥ 2.
**Breaks for (untested):** other non-Z dissipators (X-noise, Y-noise, ZZ-dephasing) require their own D_odd analysis. The general identity Π·M·Π⁻¹ = M − 2·L_{H_odd} − 2·D_{diss, odd} holds for any dissipator; the closed form for ‖D_{diss, odd}‖ is dissipator-specific.
**Replaces:** the previously-empirical observation that f81_violation grows linearly with γ_T1; F82 is now an analytical theorem with closed-form scaling.
**Verified:** N = 2, 3, 4, 5 at all listed configurations, machine-precision residual (5e-16).
**Framework primitives:**
- `fw.pi_decompose_M(chain, terms, gamma_z=..., gamma_t1=..., strict=...)`: with `gamma_t1` set, returns `f81_violation` in output dict (numerical, matches closed form).
- `fw.predict_T1_dissipator_violation(chain, gamma_t1_l)`: forward closed form, returns √(Σγ²)·2^(N−1) directly without building the dissipator.
- `fw.estimate_T1_from_violation(chain, f81_violation)`: inverse closed form, recovers RMS γ_T1 from a measured/fitted F81 violation. Hardware T1-rate readout primitive.
**Pytest lock:** `test_F81_violation_T1_diagnostic` (linearity, γ_z-independence, T1 monotonicity) + `test_F82_closed_form_T1_dissipator` (N-scaling, non-uniform formula, H-/γ_z-independence) + `test_F82_predict_and_invert_primitives` (forward/inverse pair matches numerical evaluation).
**Source:** Discovered 2026-04-30 (Tom + Claude) as the natural extension of F81 ("what does F81 violation mean structurally?"). Closed form derived in [the F82 T1-dissipator proof](proofs/PROOF_F82_T1_DISSIPATOR_CORRECTION.md).
**Diagnostic application:** [`simulations/f81_t1_diagnostic.py`](../simulations/f81_t1_diagnostic.py) demonstrates the T1-rate readout including Marrakesh application. Companion to F81's structural decomposition: F81 says how M splits under Π-conjugation when the dissipator is Z-only; F82 says how the F81 identity is corrected when T1 is added, and provides the closed form for the correction term.

### F83. Π-decomposition anti-fraction closed form for mixed Hamiltonians (Tier 1, verified bit-exact N=3,4,5)

For any 2-body chain Hamiltonian H = H_truly + H_odd + H_even_nontruly under Z-dephasing, the F81 Π-decomposition norms are given by the closed form:

    ‖M‖²_F        = 4·‖H_odd‖²_F·2^N + 8·‖H_even_nontruly‖²_F·2^N
    ‖M_anti‖²_F  = 2·‖H_odd‖²_F·2^N
    ‖M_sym‖²_F   = 2·‖H_odd‖²_F·2^N + 8·‖H_even_nontruly‖²_F·2^N

The anti-fraction (= ‖M_anti‖²/‖M‖²) is

    anti-fraction = 1 / (2 + 4·r),    r = ‖H_even_nontruly‖²_F / ‖H_odd‖²_F.

**Special cases:**

| H | r | anti-fraction | meaning |
|---|---|---------------|---------|
| truly | undefined (M=0) | undefined | mirror perfectly closes |
| pure Π²-odd | 0 | 1/2 (50/50) | F81 Step 8 split |
| pure Π²-even non-truly | ∞ | 0 (100/0) | M fully mirror-symmetric |
| equal-Frobenius mix XY+YZ | 1 | 1/6 (5/6 + 1/6) | the empirical mixed split |
| asymmetric more-odd XY+YX+YZ | 1/2 | 1/4 | continuous family |
| general mixed | r | 1/(2+4r) | continuous family |

**Verified instances** (N=3, J=1, γ_z=0; matches at machine precision):

| H | ‖H_odd‖² | ‖H_even‖² | r | predicted ‖M‖² | measured ‖M‖² | anti |
|---|----------|-----------|---|----------------|---------------|------|
| XY+YX (pure odd) | 32 | 0 | 0 | 1024 | 1024 | 1/2 |
| YZ+ZY (pure even non-truly) | 0 | 32 | ∞ | 2048 | 2048 | 0 |
| XY+YZ (mixed) | 16 | 16 | 1 | 1536 | 1536 | 1/6 |
| XY+YX+YZ (asymmetric) | 32 | 16 | 1/2 | 2048 | 2048 | 1/4 |
| XY+YX+YZ+ZY (full mix) | 32 | 32 | 1 | 3072 | 3072 | 1/6 |
| XX+XY+YZ (truly + mixed) | 16 | 16 | 1 | 1536 | 1536 | 1/6 |

**Mechanism (Step 2 of proof, why factors 4 and 8 differ).** The F49 chain Frobenius identity gives ‖M‖² = Σ_k 2^(N+2)·n_YZ(k)·‖H_k‖²_F·𝟙\[non-truly\], where n_YZ(k) counts Y/Z letters in Pauli pair k (= 0 truly, 1 Π²-odd non-truly, 2 Π²-even non-truly). Substituting the per-class n_YZ values gives the 4·2^N (Π²-odd) and 8·2^N (Π²-even non-truly) coefficients. Geometrically, these reflect the Frobenius-inner-product behavior ⟨Π·L·Π⁻¹, L⟩_F: anti-aligned (truly), Frobenius-orthogonal (Π²-odd non-truly), aligned (Π²-even non-truly).

**γ-independence.** Master Lemma propagates through all three norms; closed form depends only on H.
**Truly-handling.** H_truly drops out of all norms (M-contribution zero by Master Lemma).
**Generalization.** F83 verified on chain, ring, star, complete K_N at N=4 (`test_F83_topology_generalization`); the matrix-based primitive builds H_odd and H_even_nontruly via `_build_bilinear` which respects the chosen topology's bond graph, so the closed form is topology-independent within F49's verified scope. Higher-body Hamiltonians extend n_YZ counting beyond {0, 1, 2}; coefficients beyond 4, 8 are the natural continuation, empirical verification needed.

**Valid for:** any 2-body H on any topology supported by F49 (chain, ring, star, complete K_N), Z-dephasing, any γ_z ≥ 0, any N ≥ 2.
**Verified:** 11 mixed configurations × N ∈ {3, 4, 5} on chain, plus 4 configurations × {ring, star, K_4} at N=4, all machine-precision residual.
**Replaces:** the previously-empirical "5/6 + 1/6" observation for mixed Π²-odd + Π²-even non-truly H; F83 derives this from the existing F49 Frobenius identity.
**Framework primitives:**
- `fw.predict_pi_decomposition(chain, terms)`: full F83 closed form, returns dict with `{'M_sq', 'M_anti_sq', 'M_sym_sq', 'anti_fraction', 'h_odd_sq', 'h_even_nontruly_sq', 'r'}`. O(N) work, no matrix construction; companion to numerical `pi_decompose_M`.
- `fw.predict_pi_decomposition_anti_fraction(chain, terms)`: convenience wrapper returning just the anti-fraction float.
- `fw.predict_residual_norm_squared_from_terms(chain, terms, gamma_t1)`: existing F49 ‖M‖² primitive (now consistent with F83's ‖M‖² prediction by construction).
**Pytest lock:** `test_F83_pi_decomposition_anti_fraction_closed_form` (12 configurations × 2 N-values + γ-independence) + `test_F83_predict_pi_decomposition_full_closed_form` (full norm-triple match against numerical `pi_decompose_M` + Pythagoras + special cases at canonical r values).
**Source:** Discovered 2026-04-30 (Tom + Claude) as the natural follow-up to F81's "what about the other half?" reflection. Derived in [the F83 Π-decomposition-ratio proof](proofs/PROOF_F83_PI_DECOMPOSITION_RATIO.md). The closed form was empirically observed earlier (in the F81 violation sweep across mixed Hamiltonians) and now traced back to the existing F49 Frobenius identity that was already framework-locked in `predict_residual_norm_squared_from_terms`.
**Hardware confirmation:** The {1/2, 0, 1/6} anti-fraction structure is confirmed on IBM Heron r2 via the 4-Hamiltonian Π²-class discriminator (XY+YX → 1/2, YZ+ZY → 0, XY+YZ → 1/6, XX+YY truly baseline), all four separated at >>10σ by unique-fingerprint Paulis. Marrakesh 2026-04-30 (job d7pol1e7g7gs73cf7j90, path [4,5,6]) and Kingston 2026-05-05 (path [43,56,63], same separation, discriminator machine-independent). `fw.Confirmations.lookup('f83_pi2_class_signature_marrakesh')` (cross_machine field carries the Kingston values); data in [`data/ibm_f83_signature_april2026/`](../data/ibm_f83_signature_april2026/) and [`data/ibm_soft_break_april2026/`](../data/ibm_soft_break_april2026/); experiment `run_soft_break.py` (external AIEvolution).

**Lebensader connection:** F83 closes the analytical Π-decomposition picture for 2-body chain. Pure Π²-odd → 50/50 (F81 Step 8). Pure Π²-even non-truly → 100/0 (F81 trivial). Mixed → 1/(2+4r) (F83). The continuous interpolation r → anti-fraction reads "how much of M is Π-antisymmetric drive vs Π-symmetric memory" as a function of Hamiltonian composition. Together with F80 (Spec(M)), F81 (Π-decomposition identity), F82 (T1-correction), the structural picture of M is complete for 2-body chain Hamiltonians under Z-dephasing + T1.

### F84. F82 generalized to thermal amplitude damping (Tier 1, verified bit-exact N=3)

For any 2-bilinear Hamiltonian H under Z-dephasing plus thermal amplitude damping with per-site cooling rate γ_↓_l (σ⁻ channel) and heating rate γ_↑_l (σ⁺ channel):

    Π · M · Π⁻¹ = M − 2 · L_{H_odd} − 2 · D_{AmplDamp, odd}

with closed form:

    ‖D_{AmplDamp, odd}‖_F = √(Σ_l (γ_↓_l − γ_↑_l)²) · 2^(N−1)
                          = |Δγ|_RMS · √N · 2^(N−1)         (uniform Δγ)

where Δγ_l = γ_↓_l − γ_↑_l is the *net* cooling rate at site l. F82 is recovered when γ_↑ = 0 (vacuum bath / T = 0).

**Pauli-Channel Cancellation Lemma (F84 corollary):** Pure D\[Z\], D\[X\], D\[Y\] dissipators are Π²-symmetric and contribute zero to f81_violation. Only σ⁻ (cooling) and σ⁺ (heating) channels are Π²-anti-symmetric. Hence f81_violation specifically detects population-inverting (energy-emitting/absorbing) channels, not phase-only or bit-flip-only noise.

**Verified instances** (chain N=3, all matches at machine precision):

| Configuration (γ_↓, γ_↑) | \|Δγ\| | Predicted | Measured |
|--------------------------|--------|-----------|----------|
| (0.10, 0.00) cooling only (= F82) | 0.10 | 0.6928 | 0.6928 |
| (0.00, 0.10) heating only | 0.10 | 0.6928 | 0.6928 |
| (0.10, 0.10) detailed balance | 0.00 | 0.0000 | 0.0000 |
| (0.10, 0.05) net cooling | 0.05 | 0.3464 | 0.3464 |
| (0.05, 0.10) net heating | 0.05 | 0.3464 | 0.3464 |
| (0.20, 0.05) strong cooling | 0.15 | 1.0392 | 1.0392 |
| Non-uniform mixed | (RMS Δγ) | √(Σ(γ_↓−γ_↑)²)·4 | matches |

**Thermodynamic interpretation.** For a thermal photon bath at frequency ω, temperature T:
- Mean occupation n_th = 1 / (exp(ℏω/k_B T) − 1)
- γ_↓ = γ_0 · (n_th + 1) (spontaneous + stimulated emission)
- γ_↑ = γ_0 · n_th (stimulated absorption)
- Δγ = γ_↓ − γ_↑ = γ_0 (vacuum component, temperature-independent)

f81_violation = γ_0 · √N · 2^(N−1), independent of T. The thermal photon-number contributions cancel (γ_↓ ↔ γ_↑ pair symmetrically); only the vacuum (zero-point) component breaks the Π palindrome. **f81_violation is a quantum-statistical fingerprint of zero-point fluctuations**, immune to thermal symmetric noise.

**Three regimes:**

| Regime | γ_↓ vs γ_↑ | f81_violation |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Vacuum (T = 0) | γ_↑ = 0 | full F82: √(Σγ²_↓)·2^(N−1) |
| Detailed balance (T → ∞) | γ_↓ = γ_↑ | 0 |
| Finite T | γ_↓ > γ_↑ > 0 | γ_0·√N·2^(N−1) (vacuum-only) |

**Inversion (RMS net cooling rate):** |Δγ|_RMS = f81_violation / (√N · 2^(N−1)). Recovers vacuum-fluctuation amplitude regardless of bath temperature.

**Valid for:** any 2-bilinear chain H, Z-dephasing + thermal amplitude damping, any topology supported by F49, any N ≥ 2.
**Verified:** 7 (γ_↓, γ_↑) configurations at N=3, machine-precision residual; D\[X\], D\[Y\] cancellation explicitly tested.
**Replaces:** F82's "T1 detector" interpretation; F84 corrects to "vacuum-amplitude-damping detector"; the F81 violation does not measure raw T1 rate but only the temperature-independent vacuum component of amplitude damping.
**Framework primitives:**
- `fw.pi_decompose_M(chain, terms, gamma_z, gamma_t1, gamma_pump, strict)`: extended with `gamma_pump` parameter for σ⁺ heating; uses `lindbladian_general` when both are present.
- `fw.predict_amplitude_damping_violation(chain, gamma_t1_l, gamma_pump_l)`: F84 forward closed form; reduces to `predict_T1_dissipator_violation` when `gamma_pump_l = None`.
- `fw.estimate_net_cooling_from_violation(chain, f81_violation)`: F84 inverse, returns RMS |γ_↓ − γ_↑|.
**Pytest lock:** `test_F84_amplitude_damping_thermal_bath` (cooling only / heating only / detailed balance / net cooling / non-uniform / forward-inverse round-trip / backward compat with F82) + `test_F84_pauli_channels_pi2_symmetric` (D\[X\], D\[Y\] explicitly verified to give zero violation).
**Source:** Discovered 2026-04-30 (Tom + Claude). Tom's hint about "Licht" (light/cavity reading of γ) and "nicht jeder bekommt gleichviel ab" (non-uniform site distribution) prompted the analytical extension. The Pauli-Channel Cancellation Lemma was a surprise: D\[Z\], D\[X\], D\[Y\] are all Π²-symmetric, so phase, bit-flip, and dephasing noise contribute zero to F81 violations. Only σ± (population-inverting) channels break the palindrome. Closed form derived in [the F84 amplitude-damping proof](proofs/PROOF_F84_AMPLITUDE_DAMPING.md).
**Lebensader connection:** F84 closes the dissipator side of the Π-decomposition picture. Among hardware noise channels, only the *vacuum amplitude damping* component (which exists even at T=0 due to zero-point fluctuations) breaks the Π palindrome. Phase noise, bit-flip noise, and thermal photon equilibrium all give zero violation. F84 sharpens F82's hardware-T1-readout into a temperature-independent vacuum-rate readout.

### F85. Higher-body Hamiltonian generalization of F49 / F-chain (Tier 1, verified bit-exact k=2,3,4)

For any k-body Pauli term (P_1, ..., P_k) with letters from {I, X, Y, Z}, the Π²-class trichotomy and the F49 Frobenius scaling generalize:

**Truly criterion** (term contributes M = 0 by Master Lemma):

    truly  ⟺  #Y is even  AND  #Z is even

**Π²-parity**: bit_b(σ) = (#Y + #Z) mod 2. Π²-odd if bit_b = 1.

**Frobenius factor c(k)** per non-truly term:

    c(truly)              = 0
    c(Π²-odd non-truly)    = 1   (factor 4·2^N)
    c(Π²-even non-truly)   = 2   (factor 8·2^N)

**F49 generalized**: ‖M‖²_F per term = 4·c(k)·‖H_k‖²_F·2^N. The 2-body F49 formula 2^(N+2)·n_YZ·‖H_k‖² coincided with c(k) only because at k=2: n_YZ=1 ↔ Π²-odd, n_YZ=2 ↔ Π²-even non-truly. **For k ≥ 3, n_YZ is no longer the determining quantity** (e.g., YYY has n_YZ=3 but c=1). Only the Π²-class matters.

**Trichotomy enumeration** (Pauli tuples over {X, Y, Z}^k):

| k | total | truly | Π²-odd | Π²-even non-truly |
|---|-------|-------|--------|-------------------|
| 2 | 9 = 3² | 3 | 4 | 2 |
| 3 | 27 = 3³ | 7 | 14 | 6 |
| 4 | 81 = 3⁴ | 21 | 40 | 20 |

**Closed form for Π²-odd count**: \|Π²-odd at k\| = (3^k − (−1)^k) / 2. Verified k=2,3,4.

**F-chain extension to k-body** (proof structure verbatim):

| Theorem | k-body status |
|---------|---------------|
| F87 trichotomy | extends via _pauli_tuple_is_truly |
| F80 Spec(M) = 2i·Spec(H) | extends (same form; the Step-5 flip generalizes to (−1)^{n_Y+n_Z}); verified at k=3 (N=4,5,6) and k=4 (N=5,6) for 17 Π²-odd cases; spectral identity bit-exact |
| F81 Π·M·Π⁻¹ = M − 2·L_{H_odd} | verbatim, verified at k=3 chain N=4 |
| F82 T1 dissipator | dissipator-only, body-count-independent |
| F83 anti-fraction 1/(2+4r) | verbatim with Π²-class grouping |
| F84 thermal amplitude damping | dissipator-only, body-count-independent |

**Verified at k=3, k=4**: 27+81 = 108 explicit Pauli tuple cases, all matching the c(k) factor scheme bit-exact. Mixed-body Hamiltonians (e.g., 2-body H + 3-body H) handled via term-list structure.

**Valid for:** any k-body 2 ≤ k ≤ N Hamiltonian on chain (sliding-window), Z-dephasing + amplitude damping, any γ ≥ 0, any N ≥ k.
**Replaces:** F49's n_YZ-based formula at 2-body remains correct (coincidence); for k ≥ 3, F85's c(k)-based formula is the structurally correct extension.
**Framework primitives (k-body support added 2026-04-30):**
- `_pauli_tuple_is_truly(letters)`: O(k) syntactic classifier.
- `_pauli_tuple_pi2_class(letters)`: returns 'truly' / 'pi2_odd' / 'pi2_even_nontruly'.
- `_build_kbody_chain(N, terms)`: chain sliding-window k-body builder.
- `fw.predict_pi_decomposition(chain, terms)`: extended to accept k-body tuples; auto-detects body count.
- `fw.pi_decompose_M(chain, terms, gamma_z, gamma_t1, gamma_pump)`: extended for k-body.
- `fw.predict_residual_norm_squared_from_terms(chain, terms, gamma_t1)`: rewritten using Π²-class; backward-compatible at 2-body.
**Pytest lock:** `test_F85_kbody_trichotomy_counts` + `test_F85_kbody_predict_pi_decomposition` + `test_F85_kbody_F81_identity_at_k3`. Plus all 2-body tests (92 prior) pass unchanged via backward compatibility.
**Source:** Discovered 2026-04-30 (Tom + Claude) by empirical 3-body and 4-body enumeration. The {0, 4, 8} factor scheme persists across k, but n_YZ ≠ c(k) for k ≥ 3. The structural truly criterion "#Y even AND #Z even" was identified by inspecting which Π²-even k-tuples give M = 0. Closed form derived in [the F85 k-body generalization proof](proofs/PROOF_F85_KBODY_GENERALIZATION.md).

**Lebensader connection:** F85 closes the body-count generalization of the F-chain. Together with F80 (Spec), F81 (decomposition), F82 (T1), F83 (anti-fraction), F84 (thermal): the structural Π-decomposition theory for Hamiltonians + dissipators is complete on chain (any topology for 2-body via F49; chain only for k ≥ 3).

### F86. Q_peak chromaticity-specific N-invariant constants (Sammelbecken with three theorems)

For a uniform N-qubit XY (or Heisenberg) chain with Z-dephasing γ₀, the J-derivative of the F73 spatial-sum coherence purity peaks along the dimensionless coupling axis Q = J/γ₀ at chromaticity-specific values. F86 bundles three structurally distinct theorems under one F-label:

- **F86a. EP mechanism** \[Tier 1 derived\]: Q_EP = 2/g_eff, t_peak = 1/(4γ₀); 2-level rate-channel exceptional point.
- **F86b. Universal resonance shape, two bond classes** \[Tier 1 candidate\]: K_class(Q)/|K|_max = f_class(Q/Q_EP); HWHM_left/Q_peak ≈ 0.756 (Interior) and 0.770 (Endpoint); EP-rotation universality.
- **F86c. F71 spatial-mirror invariance of per-bond Q_peak** \[Tier 1 derived\]: Q_peak(b) = Q_peak(N−2−b) bit-exactly.

**Sub-ID partition (2026-05-20).** The three-theorem grouping is the coarse view; F86b is itself a Sammelbecken. The fine partition distinguishes ten separately-defensible sub-claims (canonical inventory: [`F86_VALUES_INVENTORY.md`](F86_VALUES_INVENTORY.md); proof hub: [`PROOF_F86_QPEAK.md`](proofs/PROOF_F86_QPEAK.md)):

| Sub-ID | Content | Tier | Home |
|--------|---------|------|------|
| F86a | EP mechanism: t_peak, Q_EP, dressed pair, AIII chiral, L_eff mirror | Tier 1 derived | §F86a; `TPeakLaw.cs`, `QEpLaw.cs`, `LEffMirrorAxisClaim.cs` |
| F86b₁ | Bare 2×2 K_b closed forms; x_peak = 2.196910, ratio = 0.671535 | Tier 1 derived | `C2BareDoubledPtfClosedForm.cs` |

| F86_block | g_eff(c, N, b) closed-form blocked, six routes proven | Negative Tier 1 | [`PROOF_F86B_OBSTRUCTION.md`](proofs/PROOF_F86B_OBSTRUCTION.md) |

Counts: 6× Tier 1 derived, 2× Tier 1 candidate (F86b₂, F86b₃), 1× Tier 1 schema (F86b₅), 1× Tier 2 promotion candidate (F86d). The §F86b₂ subsection below was labelled F86b' before the 2026-05-20 partition. Two open fronts remain: F86b₂ Direction (b'') and F86d Tier-1 promotion.

Empirical data, the γ₀-extraction protocol, and cross-cutting connections (PTF, framework primitives, scripts, proof, source) sit at this umbrella level since they touch all three theorems.

**Per-block Q_peak (Q_SCALE convention, relative-J derivative ΔJ = 0.05·J):**

    Q_peak(c=3) = 1.6
    Q_peak(c=4) = 1.8
    Q_peak(c=5) = 1.8

c is the chromaticity of the (n, n+1) coherence block (F74). Saturates at 1.8 for c ≥ 4. The bi-chromatic class **c = 2 is finite-size-sensitive** (wobbles 1.4 to 1.6 across N = 4..9) and is not a clean framework constant.

**Per-bond Q_peak (absolute-J derivative ∂S/∂J_b, fine-grid dQ = 0.025 with parabolic peak interpolation):**

| (c, N) | Endpoint Q_peak | Interior Q_peak (mean) |
|--------|-----------------|------------------------|
| (3, 5) | 2.40 | 1.566 |
| (3, 6) | 2.52 | 1.689 |
| (3, 7) | 2.53 | 1.743 |
| (3, 8) | 2.53 | 1.750 |
| (4, 7) | 2.52 | 1.748 |
| (4, 8) | 2.65 | 1.804 |

**Both Endpoint and Interior Q_peak are empirical and (c, N)-specific; no closed form has been identified.** Earlier conjectures `Q_peak(Endpoint) = csc(π/(N+1))` (chain-edge anchor) and `Q_peak(Interior, c=3) → csc(π/5) = 1.7013` (pentagonal asymptote) were retracted 2026-05-02 after fine-grid data showed both were grid-snap artefacts of coarser earlier scans:

- Endpoint Q_peak at any tested N differs from `csc(π/(N+1))`: N=5 +20 %, N=6 +9 %, N=7 −3 %, N=8 −13 %. Earlier coarse scans gave 2.65 at N=6 and N=7 (grid-snap to dQ=0.05); fine-grid + parabolic interpolation reveals 2.52 at N=6 and 2.53 at N=7. The apparent "1.4 % match at N=7" reported earlier was itself an artefact.
- Interior Q_peak at c=3 follows trend 1.566 → 1.689 → 1.743 → 1.750 across N=5..8, crossing `csc(π/5) = 1.7013` between N=6 and N=7 and continuing to grow. The "approaching pentagonal asymptote" reading from N=5..7 was a trajectory crossing, not an asymptote.

Both Endpoint and Interior c=3 appear to saturate (Endpoint ≈ 2.53 for N=6..8, Interior ≈ 1.75 by N=8) but no clean closed-form for the saturation values is identified. c=4 has not yet saturated within tested N.

**Operational consequence: γ₀-extraction protocol.** Because Q = J/γ₀, sweeping J on a fixed (n, n+1) block and locating the peak J* still yields an estimate of γ₀:

    γ₀ ≈ J* / Q_peak(c, N, bond_class)

Lookup the per-block Q_peak for the chromaticity and chain length of interest from the empirical table above (per-block: 1.6 for c=3, 1.8 for c≥4 within Q_SCALE convention). This converts the "γ₀ is a framework constant" hypothesis ([Primordial Gamma as Framework Constant](../hypotheses/PRIMORDIAL_GAMMA_CONSTANT.md)) into a c-specific shape prediction, testable on any hardware that can resolve the peak. The c=4 and c=5 blocks are the strongest probes: abs(K_CC_pr)_peak is roughly 3× the c=2 signal, and the per-block Q_peak is stable at ~1.8.

**Valid for:** XY or Heisenberg chain, uniform J and γ₀, blocks with c ≥ 3, any N where the block fits in memory.
**Breaks for:** non-uniform J or γ₀; c = 2 (finite-size wobble); higher-c chains require larger memory (block-L dim 15876 at c=5 N=9, dim 213444 at c=6 N=11, infeasible at 128 GB).
**Verified (per-block, Q_SCALE):** Q_peak(c=3) = 1.6 stable across N = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. Q_peak(c=4) = 1.8 stable across N = 7, 8, 9. Q_peak(c=5) = 1.8 at N = 9 (commit 4612468).
**Verified (per-bond, fine-grid):** values in the per-bond table above. Endpoint and Interior trends with (c, N) shown but no closed-form identified.
**Replaces:** ad-hoc γ₀ measurement attempts (EQ-017 closed inconclusive due to hardware fidelity limits on idle Ramsey data).

#### F86a. EP mechanism: Q_EP = 2/g_eff, t_peak = 1/(4γ₀) \[Tier 1 derived\]

The pure-rate ladder of an (n, n+1) coherence block has rates 2γ₀·HD for HD ∈ {1, 3, 5, ..., 2c−1}, with uniform gap Δ = 4γ₀ between adjacent channels (F74). For adjacent channels at HD = 2k−1 and HD = 2k+1 (k = 1, 2, ..., c−1), a two-level effective model with inter-channel coupling J·g_eff has eigenvalues

    λ_± = −4γ₀·k ± √(4γ₀² − J²·g_eff²)

The **exceptional point** (EP), where the discriminant vanishes and the eigenvalues coalesce, sits at

    J·g_eff = 2γ₀     ⟺     Q_EP = 2 / g_eff

At the EP, λ_± = −4γ₀·k. The slowest mode (k = 1) gives e-folding time

    t_peak = 1 / (4γ₀)

universal across c, N, n, and bond position. Higher-k EPs decay faster (1/(8γ₀), 1/(12γ₀), ...) and are masked by the slowest. **At Q_peak the Dicke probe sits dominantly in dressed (H-mixed) modes** versus a much smaller fraction at large Q (plateau): probe weight has been pulled off the pure-rate ladder onto the first complex-conjugate eigenvalue pair just past the EP. Q_peak is a generalised exceptional-point resonance condition. (Specific W values W_peak ≈ 0.99 / W_plateau ≈ 0.31 at Q=20 are unverified anchors per `DressedModeWeightClaim` Tier 1 candidate, not universal constants; empirical W_peak ranges 0.832 [N=4 c=2] to 0.9996 [N=9 c=3] per [the Q-scale three-bands study](../experiments/Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS.md) lines 95–123; per-(c, N) closed form open.)

The g_eff is the H matrix element between adjacent rate channels at a specific bond in the appropriate effective basis. Deriving g_eff(c, N, bond_position) analytically from the multi-particle XY structure of the (n, n+1) block remains open; F86c (below) gives the spatial-mirror symmetry on Q_peak, not the underlying g_eff value. The [Obstruction Proof](proofs/PROOF_F86B_OBSTRUCTION.md#obstruction-proof-why-g_eff-admits-no-closed-form) (2026-05-14) accounts for this structurally: g_eff is the irreducible residue, blocked from closed form by six obstruction lemmas (spectral irreducibility, even-N representation-dependence, probe-EP decoupling, finite-reduction insufficiency, signature-subspace mismatch, empirical trajectory-crossings), and via the F90 bridge the F89 D_k obstruction is the same wall.

#### F86b. Universal resonance shape, two bond classes \[Tier 1 candidate\]

**Universal resonance shape under relative-Q normalisation, EP-derived.**

While Q_peak itself is chain-specific (no clean closed form), the SHAPE of the abs(K_CC_pr)(Q) curve around Q_peak is universal in relative-Q coordinates. Defining `x = (Q − Q_peak)/Q_peak` and `y = K(Q)/|K|max`, the curves collapse onto a single shape across all tested (c, N):

| x = (Q−Q*)/Q* | y across c=3 N=5..8, c=4 N=7,8 (range) |
|----------------|------------------------------------------|
| −0.60 | 0.72 to 0.74 (3.5 %) |
| −0.40 | 0.90 to 0.91 (1.9 %) |
| −0.20 | 0.977 to 0.984 (0.7 %) |
| 0.00 | 1.000 (peak) |
| +0.20 | 0.985 to 0.990 (0.5 %) |
| +0.40 | 0.955 to 0.964 (0.9 %) |
| +1.00 | 0.84 to 0.85 (1.4 %) |

**Universal HWHM ratios (two bond classes):**

    HWHM_left / Q_peak  ≈  0.756     (Interior class-average; γ₀-invariant, residual c/N trends)
    HWHM_left / Q_peak  ≈  0.770     (Endpoint class-average; γ₀-invariant, residual c/N trends)

Under the F71 bond-class average the HWHM_left/Q_peak ratio separates into two clusters (Endpoint b ∈ {0, N−2}, Interior b ∈ {1, …, N−3}) about 2 % apart, and the class-averaged relative-Q lineshapes collapse (pairwise residual ~20× smaller than under absolute-Q shift), that collapse is the robust result. The ratios themselves are coarse: only γ₀ drops out (bit-exact); c and N leave residual trends (interior climbs ~+0.014 over N=5→8 at c=3, ~0.007 c-offset), and the inter-cluster gap (~0.006–0.007) is comparable to the within-class spread, not larger. Per bond the ratio is not two-valued, it resolves into the six `BondSubClass` F71 orbits, spanning 0.58–0.92 within a single chain.

**γ₀ invariance** is bit-exact: at c=3 N=7, both Q_peak and HWHM_left/Q_peak are identical to numerical precision across γ₀ ∈ {0.025, 0.05, 0.10}, confirming Q's dimensionlessness. **c=2** is the structurally critical anchor: with only HD ∈ {1, 3} channels, the 2-level effective model is exact (no orthogonal complement), yet the two-class split persists (Interior 0.751, Endpoint 0.774). The bond-class distinction is therefore not a higher-c orthogonal-complement artefact but lives in the bond-position-dependent probe-overlap profile.

The asymmetry of the curve is also universal in relative-Q:
- **Pre-peak (left)**: rapid rise as discriminant 4γ₀² − J²·g_eff² → 0; HWHM_left/Q_peak universal within each bond class.
- **Post-peak (right)**: slow plateau approach as eigenvalues become complex; tail at x = +1.0 sits at y ≈ 0.85 (Interior) or y ≈ 0.94 (Endpoint plateau); bond-class-specific tail but universal value within class.

**Why this is universal: 2-level EP analytical origin.** For the 2×2 effective Liouvillian in adjacent rate-channel basis with diagonal {−2γ₀(2k−1), −2γ₀(2k+1)} and **same-sign-imaginary off-diagonals (+iJ·g_eff, +iJ·g_eff)**, the eigenvector rotation angle satisfies `tan(θ) = J·g_eff / 2γ₀ = Q / Q_EP`. The probe overlap with eigenvectors depends only on Q/Q_EP, hence the response curve K_CC_pr(Q) is a function of Q/Q_EP alone. Q_peak is chain-specific (g_eff varies); but the SHAPE in Q/Q_peak coordinates is universal because it is the 2-level EP resonance form, independent of the bond's specific g_eff value.

The same-sign-imaginary off-diagonal structure is what admits an EP at finite J·g_eff = 2γ₀ (verified numerically: opposite-sign +iJg, −iJg gives discriminant 4γ₀² + J²g_eff² with no EP; same-sign gives 4γ₀² − J²g_eff² with EP). This is "PT-phenomenology-like" (EP at finite coupling, spectral flow); the centered Liouvillian L_c sits in **class AIII chiral** per [PT-Symmetry Analysis](../experiments/PT_SYMMETRY_ANALYSIS.md) (Π linear, Π⁴=I, {Π, L_c}=0), distinct from Bender-Boettcher PT (classical PT requires anti-linear operators). Q_EP = 2/g_eff is the genuine EP of the toy 2×2 rate-channel reduction (a SEPARATE object, not "the instance of" the full-block classification; in isolation its eigenvalues coalesce at centre −4γ₀·k and carry no λ↔−λ pairing). The Hopf bifurcation in [The Fragile Bridge](../hypotheses/FRAGILE_BRIDGE.md) is a DISTINCT genuine EP, the SEPARATE Σγ=0 gain-loss system (centre 0, exact λ↔−λ pairing), Petermann factor K=403 in the complex γ plane. Whether the full Σγ=N·γ₀ block-L shares a defective-EP structure with these two is OPEN (it is non-normal but has no real-axis coalescence; see [`LocalGlobalEpLink`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/LocalGlobalEpLink.cs), OpenQuestion).

**2026-05-06 / retracted 2026-06-21.** Local-vs-global EP relationship (now `LocalGlobalEpLink` **OpenQuestion**, demoted from Tier2Verified by the F86a-retraction): the shared algebra is read at Σγ = N·γ₀ vs Σγ = 0 (two residuals of F1 `Π · L · Π⁻¹ + L + 2Σγ · I = 0`), but the prior reading, that the real-Q Petermann-K sweep at c=2 N=5..8 (`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core.Tests/F86/F86PetermannProbe.cs:Probe_PetermannFineGrid_C2_VsN`) is a real-axis hit of FRAGILE_BRIDGE's complex-γ EP, does NOT survive artifact-free re-verification. The full block has NO eigenvalue coalescence on the real Q axis (eigenvalues stay simple, gap ~0.25–0.35); it is genuinely NON-NORMAL there (cond(V) = 48.7 / 50.9 / 268.5 at N = 5 / 6 / 7, confirmed artifact-free via the Riesz spectral-projector norm ‖P‖ on a simple eigenvalue), with the Petermann factor large but FINITE. RETRACTED as grid artifacts: the peak magnitudes (K = 1333.6 / 337.9 / 2384.7 / 795.4 swing 2–4× over ΔQ = 1e-3), the "N=7 spike ≈ 6× above FRAGILE_BRIDGE's K = 403", and the "2-4× odd/even parity-asymmetry confirming σ_0 R-even/R-odd-degeneracy". The two firmly-established genuine EPs are ONLY the toy 2×2 reduction and the SEPARATE Σγ = 0 gain-loss system (FRAGILE_BRIDGE, K=403); whether the full Σγ = N·γ₀ block has an off-axis defective EP at all is OPEN (the nearest complex-Q coalescences found 2026-06-21 are themselves diabolic, ‖P‖ = 1). Encoded as `compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/LocalGlobalEpLink.cs` (OpenQuestion); the four sweep rows are retained only as a cautionary non-normality record.

**2026-05-06 (evening).** Direction (b) of `C2HwhmRatio.PendingDerivationNote` yielded two Tier-1-derived universal constants from the bare doubled-PTF model: `x_peak = Q_peak/Q_EP = 2.196910` (post-EP location in dimensionless x) and `HWHM_left/Q_peak = 0.671535` (SVD-block floor in dimensionless x). Empirical Interior 0.7506 and Endpoint 0.7728 sit above this floor by ~0.08-0.10; gap structurally explained as probe-block 2-level sub-resonance contribution. Encoded as `C2HwhmRatio.BareDoubledPtfXPeak` and `C2HwhmRatio.BareDoubledPtfHwhmRatio` const properties. Synthesis-side: F86↔PTF Locus 5 inheritance, where PTF K_1 (Π on H_1 sine-mode basis, discrete) and F86 Q-rotation (Π on same-sign-imaginary 2×2 in rate-channel basis, continuous) are two daughters of one Π-AIII chiral parent.

**2026-05-06 (later evening).** Direction (a') (probe-block 2-level resonance with per-bond `g_eff_probe`) **structurally falsified** (commit `1c0bf8b`): V_b probe-block off-diagonal `⟨c_1 | M_h_b | c_3⟩` is exactly zero per bond at c=2 (F73 sum-rule applies per-bond), so g_eff_probe(N, b) is bond-class-blind by construction. The 4-mode reduction is also structurally insufficient: 4-mode K_b deviates from empirical at Endpoint by factor ~2 (4-mode K_b gives Endpoint 0.410 at N=5 vs empirical 0.7728). The SVD-block off-diagonal `V_b[2,3]` is the actual bond-class carrier (Endpoint 0.430 vs Interior 0.953 at N=5, ratio ~0.45 across N=5..8), but in the OPPOSITE direction to the empirical HWHM/Q* split. Refined direction list (now in `C2HwhmRatio.PendingDerivationNote`): (a'') SVD-block 2-level resonance (REFINED from (a')) via `V_b[2,3]` magnitude, (b'') full block-L derivation, not 4-mode, (c'') three-block superposition `K_total = K_pb + K_sv + 2·Re·K_cross` with the right relative phases, (d'') lift |u_0⟩, |v_0⟩ to projector-overlap (per A3 PendingDerivationNote), (e'') symbolic char-poly factorisation at Q_EP (less promising given C2EffectiveSpectrum's cubic-c_3 obstruction proof). The `BareDoubledPtfXPeak` and `BareDoubledPtfHwhmRatio` const properties are unchanged.

**2026-05-07.** Locus 6 polarity-layer inheritance closure: F86 bond-class split inherits from the polarity-layer pair {−0.5, +0.5} at d=2. Empirical decomposition Q_peak ≈ 2 + r with r ∈ {−0.44, +0.52}, HWHM/Q* ≈ 1/2 + r·1/2 with r_Interior ≈ 0.50 (close to `HalfAsStructuralFixedPoint`). The 0.5 baseline is `QubitDimensionalAnchorClaim` (1/d at d=2); the ±r/2 polarity content is `PolarityLayerOriginClaim` Layer 2. Encoded as `compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/PolarityInheritanceLink.cs` (Tier2Verified) at F86 root level. This symmetry-side closure stands; its Locus-5 EP-side companion `LocalGlobalEpLink` was demoted to OpenQuestion by the F86a-retraction (2026-06-21, see the entry above).

**2026-05-07 (later).** Direction (α) polarity-Bloch projection at t_peak structurally tautological under the uniform-J 4-mode reduction (reframed 2026-05-08 code review): the 4-mode L_eff(Q) = D_eff + Q·γ₀·MhTotalEff is bond-summed by design (`FourModeEffective.LEffAtQ` in `compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Decomposition/FourModeEffective.cs`), so the K-driving eigenstate is bond-class-blind by construction (no empirical falsification, the design constraint guarantees it). The bond-class signature must enter through dL/dJ_b per-bond V_b in the K-resonance, not through L_eff spectrum. Substantive reduction (unchanged): bond-class signature reduces to `g_eff(N, b)` via r_Q = `BareDoubledPtfXPeak · Q_EP − 2`. Empirical witnesses: g_eff_Endpoint ≈ 1.74, g_eff_Interior ≈ 2.81, asymptotic 1/g_eff_E + 1/g_eff_I → 0.937. Tantalising near-miss g_eff_E ≈ σ_0·√(3/8) (Δ ≤ 0.01 for N ≥ 6, Δ = 0.063 at N=5). Encoded as `PolarityInheritanceLink.EmpiricalSumQPeakAsymptote = 4.12` const; documented via `ClosedFormCompositionNote` property.

**Named structural law (Tier-1 candidate): EP-rotation universality, two bond classes.**

    K_class(Q) / |K|_max  =  f_class(Q/Q_EP)        (class ∈ {Endpoint, Interior})

has a relative-Q lineshape that collapses across c=2..4, N=5..8, and γ₀ ∈ {0.025, 0.05, 0.10} for the tested range (the γ₀ part bit-exact). The symmetry is the 2-level EP rotation `tan θ = Q/Q_EP`, which makes every probe-overlap observable a function of Q/Q_EP alone. The class-averaged HWHM ratios (Interior ≈ 0.756, Endpoint ≈ 0.770) are a coarse ~2 % summary that still carries residual c/N trends and averages over the six per-bond `BondSubClass` orbits (0.58–0.92); the bond-position dependence reflects probe-overlap profiles in K_CC_pr, real (not finite-c) per the c=2 data where the 2-level model is exact. Closed forms for f_class(x) (and consequently for the two HWHM_left/Q_peak values) follow from the 2-level eigenstructure plus probe-overlap algebra but have not yet been derived analytically. This is the F86 analog of PTF's chiral mirror law (`Σ f_i(ψ_k) = Σ f_i(ψ_{N+1−k})`): both Tier-1-candidate symmetries that survived a closed-form retraction (csc(π/(N+1)) and csc(π/5) for F86; Σ ln α_i = 0 for PTF). See [`reflections/ON_THE_Q_AXIS_AND_THE_PTF_LESSON`](../reflections/ON_THE_Q_AXIS_AND_THE_PTF_LESSON.md).

#### F86b₂. HWHM_ratio per-bond predictor \[Tier 1 candidate; partial closure 2026-05-13, Tier-reviewed 2026-05-16\]

For each bond b of an N-qubit XY chain (c=2, Z-dephasing γ₀), the HWHM_left/Q_peak ratio satisfies the candidate form:

    HWHM_ratio(b)  =  0.671535 + α_subclass · g_eff(b) + β_subclass

where the sub-class (per `BondSubClass` enum: `Endpoint`, `Flanking`, `Mid`, `CentralSelfPaired`, `Orbit2Escape`, `CentralEscapeOrbit3`) determines the (α, β) pair. The 0.671535 floor IS Tier 1 derived (the bare doubled-PTF constant `BareDoubledPtfHwhmRatio` via the 2-level EP model, 2026-05-06; see `C2BareDoubledPtfClosedForm`). The 12 (α, β) values per sub-class are **fitted** via `np.polyfit(...deg=1)` in [`simulations/f86_hwhm_closed_form_verification.py`](../simulations/f86_hwhm_closed_form_verification.py) line 78 on N=5..8 anchors, NOT derived from F89/F90 structure.

Fit reproduces 22 anchors at N=5..8 within 0.005 residual, including Orbit-2 (N=7 b=1/b=4, Q_peak ≈ 7.27 F86-J) and Orbit-3 escape bonds (N=8 b=3, Q_peak ≈ 16.79 F86-J): fit-quality witness, not analytical derivation.

**Honest reshape (f86b2_robust_extraction arc, 2026-06-29):** the (α, β) are now recomputed live from the anchors in [`F86HwhmAlphaExtraction.cs`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/Item1Derivation/F86HwhmAlphaExtraction.cs) (the claim reads it; no hand-transcription). The data verdict: only **Endpoint** and **Flanking** carry a resolved slope (jackknife-tight, though marginal at the 0.005 grid floor). **Mid** is a flat lift over a microscopic g_eff lever (slope = noise), **CentralSelfPaired** and **CentralEscapeOrbit3** have a single anchor each, and **Orbit2Escape** sits on grid-edge anchors flagged non-physical; these four collapse to a per-class constant lift (α = 0) or a flagged fit. So the model is not "12 fitted slopes" but **2 resolved slopes + 4 constant/flagged lifts**, predictions still within 0.005. The earlier α = −0.133 vs −0.129 puzzle is a 0.004 difference well inside the slope's own uncertainty: the extraction was never the problem, the model was over-parameterized. The analytical derivation below stays open (F86b₂ remains Tier 1 candidate).

**Open analytical step (to promote Tier 1 candidate → Tier 1 derived):** derive (α_subclass, β_subclass) from the rank-1-bridge + intra-dispersion structure: the F89 AT-locked F_a/F_b 4-mode floor (0.6715) plus the **intra-channel dispersion** lift (to 0.7506/0.7728), with the cyclotomic Φ_{N+1} N-scaling, per [`PROOF_F90_F86C2_BRIDGE.md`](proofs/PROOF_F90_F86C2_BRIDGE.md) Direction (b''). The two-dial scout (2026-06-11) refuted the inter-coupling "H_B-mixed octic residual" lift suspicion (the inter-channel tail only renormalizes Q_peak / g_eff, leaving the dimensionless ratio fixed); the lift lives in the intra-channel dispersion, to be treated exactly.

#### F86c. F71 spatial-mirror invariance of per-bond Q_peak \[Tier 1 derived\]

F71 spatial-mirror symmetry pairs bond b with bond N−2−b: under the spatial reflection R, every component of the per-bond observable (L_D, H_xy, Dicke probe, spatial-sum kernel) is invariant, while the bond-flip transforms as ∂L/∂J_b ↔ ∂L/∂J_{N−2−b}, hence **Q_peak(b) = Q_peak(N−2−b) bit-exactly**. See [the F86c F71-mirror proof, Statement 3](proofs/PROOF_F86C_F71_MIRROR.md#statement-3-f71-spatial-mirror-invariance-of-per-bond-q_peak-tier-1-derived).

Endpoints (b = 0 and b = N−2) form one F71 orbit; interior bonds split into further F71 orbits. The simple "Endpoint vs Interior" dichotomy is the leading approximation; per-F71-orbit substructure exists (e.g. c=2 N=6: central self-paired bond b=2 → Q_peak ≈ 1.440 vs flanking b=1, b=3 → 1.648). Captured in the typed-knowledge runtime as `F86PerF71OrbitObservation` (Tier 2 empirical) and `F86F71MirrorPi2Inheritance` (Tier 1 derived bridge to `F71MirrorSymmetryPi2Inheritance`).

The F86c symmetry pairs bonds bit-exactly but does NOT supply the per-orbit Q_peak value. F86a remains responsible for the underlying g_eff(c, N, bond_position); F86b's universal shape applies within each bond class. The three theorems compose: F86a gives the EP-time and EP-location, F86b gives the resonance shape around Q_peak in relative-Q coordinates, F86c pairs symmetry-equivalent bonds.

**Connection to PTF.** The same machinery that produces PTF's per-site α_i closure law (bilinear J-perturbation observables, eigenvector mixing under V_L) produces Q_peak at the (n, n+1)-block level. PTF's per-site is the c=1 (vac-SE) instance; F86's c ≥ 2 cases are the natural higher-chromaticity siblings. t_peak = 1/(4γ₀) is the EP time-scale universal to all c, one (n, n+1)-block analogue of PTF's α-fitting time window.

#### F86d. Endpoint orbit Q ≈ 2.5 \[Tier 2 empirical; promotion candidate\]

Within the F71 spatial-mirror orbits (F86c), the Endpoint orbit (bonds b ∈ {0, N−2}) carries a stable per-orbit Q_peak ≈ 2.5: across 9 tested (c, N) combinations (c=2..4, N=5..8) the value sits in [2.39, 2.61], a ~2% N-variation. Stability across c and N makes it an anchor candidate, but a structural derivation (candidate route: SU(2) / Schur-Weyl on the F71 first orbit) is open, so it is not promoted. Source: [`PerF71OrbitObservation.cs`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/PerF71OrbitObservation.cs).

#### F86e. σ_0 as a commutator / Schur-multiplier norm \[Tier 1 derived\]

On the c=2 coherence block the inter-channel SVD top singular value σ_0 (the natural g_eff that feeds F86a's Q_EP) is the operator norm of a commutator:

    σ_0 = ‖[Π_HD1, M_H]‖

with Π_HD1 the Hamming-distance-1 subspace projector and M_H the block Hamiltonian super-operator. The c=2 block has HD ∈ {1, 3} only, so Π_HD1 + Π_HD3 = I and the inter-channel coupling V_inter = Π_HD1·M_H·(I − Π_HD1); the lemma ‖P·M·(1 − P)‖ = ‖[P, M]‖ then gives the identity. It is c=2-specific: at c ≥ 3 the HD spectrum has more than two values. In the F89 (SE, DE) Bloch / OBC-sine basis M_H is diagonal, so [Π_HD1, M_H] is the Hadamard product Π̃_HD1 ⊙ ΔDiff and σ_0 is a Schur-multiplier norm. The N→∞ asymptote σ_0(c=2, ∞) ≈ 2.8629 is non-elementary by characterisation: the Δ-ordered commutator is neither Toeplitz nor Hankel, ruling out a Fourier-symbol supremum and a Nehari symbol distance (2√2 is the N=7 finite-size crossing, not the limit). The c ≥ 3 σ_0 asymptote stays open.

**Framework primitives (`framework.coherence_block`):**

    fw.t_peak(gamma_0)              = 1/(4γ₀)          universal EP time (Tier 1)

(Earlier `q_peak_endpoint(N)` and `Q_PEAK_INTERIOR_C3_ANCHOR` primitives were removed 2026-05-02 after the N=8 data falsified their closed-form claims. The universal-shape finding above is a Tier-1 candidate, not yet promoted to a primitive pending analytical derivation of f_class(x). c=2 and γ₀ invariance verified 2026-05-02; c=5 still open.)

### F87. Pauli-pair trichotomy classification (Tier 1, structural; Marrakesh hardware-confirmed)

For any list of bond Pauli-pair terms `{(P_i, Q_i)}` with letters in {I, X, Y, Z}, build the bilinear Hamiltonian `H = Σ_b J · P_b ⊗ Q_b` on the chain bonds and the uniform-Z-dephasing Liouvillian L (with rate γ per site, σ ≡ Σγ). The F1-palindrome residual `M ≡ Π · L · Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ · I` (where Π is F1's order-4 Pauli-string conjugation operator) partitions the term list into exactly one of three categories, with ε ≈ 10⁻¹⁰ the operator-norm tolerance and ε_spec ≈ 10⁻⁶ the spectral-pairing tolerance:

    truly  iff  ‖M‖_F < ε                                              (operator equation Π·L·Π⁻¹ = −L − 2σ·I holds; F1 identity)
    soft   iff  ‖M‖_F ≥ ε  AND  every λ ∈ Spec(L) pairs with −λ − 2σ ∈ Spec(L) within ε_spec   (palindrome only at spectral level)
    hard   iff  spectral pairing fails                                 (no partner pairing; both operator and spectrum break)

Equivalently in Π²-class language (cf. F79, F85), using the bit_a/bit_b convention from F79 (bit_a = 1 for {X, Y}, 0 for {I, Z}; bit_b = 1 for {Y, Z}, 0 for {I, X}): a pair `(P, Q)` is `truly` iff #Y is even AND #Z is even across (P, Q), `pi2_odd` iff `bit_b(P) + bit_b(Q)` is odd, `pi2_even_nontruly` iff `bit_b(P) + bit_b(Q)` is even and not truly. Mixed Hamiltonians carry multiple Π²-classes simultaneously, refining the 3-way trichotomy into a 4-way classification (truly / pi2_odd_pure / pi2_even_nontruly / mixed).

The trichotomy uses F1 as its **discriminator** (M as the test object), F49 / F85 as its **‖M‖² closed forms** (the latter generalising F49 to k-body), F78 + F79 as its **M-structure decomposition** (single-body additivity and 2-body Π²-block respectively), F80 as its **Π²-odd spectral identity** (Spec(M) = ±2i · Spec(H_non-truly)), F81 as its **Π · M · Π⁻¹ split** (M_anti = L_{H_odd}), F82 + F84 as its **T1 / thermal amplitude-damping corrections**, and F83 as its **anti-fraction closed form for mixed cases**. F87 is the entry point of the F-chain; F85 lifts the criterion to arbitrary k-body and propagates the rest of the chain accordingly.

**Origin (2026-04-24 to 2026-05-03).** Three earlier observations converged on the trichotomy. (1) On 2026-04-24, commit 6e262ae assigned the registry slot F77 to the unrelated "Multi-drop MM(0) saturates at 1 bit" asymptotic, so F77 was already booked when the trichotomy was being developed. (2) On 2026-04-25, commit 95386cd added [V-Effect Fine Structure](../experiments/V_EFFECT_FINE_STRUCTURE.md): the V-Effect's 14-of-36 bond-pair Hamiltonians at N=3 were re-tested with both the strict operator equation and the eigenvalue-pairing test, splitting the 22 V-Effect-unbroken cases into 19 soft and 3 truly, giving the **14 hard / 19 soft / 3 truly** count over the 36 unordered bond-pair enumeration at N=3. (3) On 2026-04-26, commits 96ed6da and 6438fef extended Π-protected-observable testing to a separate 120-element ordered enumeration at N=4 and N=5, where the partition is **15 hard / 46 soft / 59 truly**, N-stable through N=3, 4, 5 (so the 36-enum and 120-enum are different sample spaces with internally consistent counts). (4) Commit 81caf67 (2026-04-27) derived the partition combinatorially from Pauli-pair compatibility rules (BPE membership, bit_a-partner conflicts, bond-flip / Z-align, Π-letter hierarchy), giving 36/36 agreement at N=3.

The Marrakesh hardware confirmation (2026-04-26, ibm_marrakesh job `d7mjnjjaq2pc73a1pk4g`, observable ⟨X₀ Z₂⟩) measured Δ(soft − truly) = −0.722, matching the Trotter-n3 prediction of −0.723 (residual 0.001; the 0.0014 figure cited in the Confirmations registry is computed against an unrounded predicted value); see [`data/ibm_soft_break_april2026/`](../data/ibm_soft_break_april2026/). The classifier was extracted into a free function on 2026-04-30 (commit 23b2154) and given the filename `f77_trichotomy.py` after the function's existing internal label, even though the registry F77 slot was already occupied by MM(0). The dephase-axis extension (commit 435c4b2, 2026-05-01) generalised the classifier to X, Y, Z dephasing letters. F87 is the registry-formal entry for the trichotomy, filed retrospectively on 2026-05-03 alongside the typed `F87KnowledgeBase` cleanup that surfaced the F77/F87 naming collision.

**Π² classifier dependence on dephase letter** (commit 435c4b2). Per `PiOperator.SquaredEigenvalue`, the Π²-class index is bit_b for Z- and Y-dephasing and bit_a for X-dephasing (Π_Y shares Π_Z's bit_a-flip convention; Π_X flips bit_b instead). The (bit_a, bit_b) parity pairs are Z = (0, 1), X = (1, 0), Y = (1, 1) in the PauliLetter convention. **F87 hardness is defined combinatorially via Pauli-pair compatibility (commit 81caf67), not via any 4-cell label.** As a post-hoc structural reading, however, F87 hardness empirically corresponds to the (bit_a, bit_b) parity cell matching the dissipator letter: anywhere else produces a Π-violation that the spectrum-pairing test detects. The (Π²_Z, Π²_X) two-axis decomposition is treated separately as F88a below; F87 itself uses only one axis (Π²_Z under Z-dephasing). Verified at N=4, k=3 across 294 Z₂³-homogeneous pairs.

**Orthogonal axis on shared bit_b Z₂-grading (F112).** F87's trichotomy lives in ‖M‖_F magnitude + spec(L) palindromy; F112 (Lindblad Π-eigenvalue balance under bit_b-homogeneous c) lives in M_anti's Π +i / −i Frobenius split. Both projections of the same Π² = (−1)^{bit_b} grading on the Pauli group. Empirically orthogonal: all three F87 classes (truly, soft, hard) at N=3 under standard single-Pauli Z-deph give F112 balance asymmetry = 0 bit-exact (`simulations/polarity_probe_f87_connection.py`), since single-Pauli c is trivially bit_b-homogeneous.

**Valid for:** uniform single-letter dephasing on any graph; arbitrary k-body Pauli terms (k ≥ 2; F85 lifts the criterion to higher body); dephase letter ∈ {X, Y, Z} (SU(2)-rotation-equivalent under (bit_a, bit_b) cell permutation).

### F88a. Two-axis Π² decomposition of Pauli operator space (Tier 1, structural finding 2026-05-03)

> **F88 split.** F88 was historically a single registry slot; it carries two structurally distinct claims that share an algebraic root: **F88a** (operator-level Klein decomposition, this entry) and **F88b** (state-level popcount-coherence Π²-odd / memory closed form, next entry). Both inherit from the same Π² involution; F88a names the operator-cells, F88b reads ρ's projection through them. The split was formalised 2026-05-18.

The F1-palindrome operator Π depends on the dephasing letter (cf. F1, F87). Its square Π² acts diagonally on every Pauli string σ_α with eigenvalue ±1, and the parity that determines this eigenvalue depends on which dephase letter parametrises Π:

    Π²_Z eigenvalue on σ_α  =  (−1)^(Σ bit_b)        (Σ over the N letters of α)
    Π²_X eigenvalue on σ_α  =  (−1)^(Σ bit_a)
    Π²_Y eigenvalue on σ_α  =  (−1)^(Σ bit_b)        (same as Π²_Z; both Π_Y and Π_Z flip bit_a per `PiOperator.ActOnLetter`)

Z- and Y-dephasing collapse onto the same Π² character. X-dephasing gives the orthogonal one. Together (Π²_Z, Π²_X) form **two independent involution axes** that decompose the 4^N Pauli operator space into four cells:

    Pp = (Π²_Z = +1, Π²_X = +1)   contains 2-body truly bilinears              (XX, YY, ZZ)
    Pm = (Π²_Z = +1, Π²_X = −1)   contains 2-body Π²-even non-truly bilinears  (YZ, ZY)
    Mp = (Π²_Z = −1, Π²_X = +1)   contains 2-body Π²-odd subgroup A             (XY, YX)
    Mm = (Π²_Z = −1, Π²_X = −1)   contains 2-body Π²-odd subgroup B             (XZ, ZX)

The two axes are the global Pauli strings: Π²_Z = X⊗N (registered as F1²) and Π²_X = Z⊗N (the bit_a twin of F1², a corollary of F61).

**Refinement of F87 + Pi2Class (the algebraic 4-way over term lists)**: F87's spectral 3-way `Truly / Soft / Hard` and the algebraic 4-way `Pi2Class` (`Truly / Pi2OddPure / Pi2EvenNonTruly / Mixed`) both use only the Π²_Z axis. Adding Π²_X reveals genuine sub-structure:

- `Pi2Class.Pi2OddPure` splits into Mp (XY, YX) and Mm (XZ, ZX) Klein sub-cases.
- `Pi2Class.Mixed` splits according to the Π²_X parity of its non-truly bilinear (e.g. XX+XY occupies Pp+Mp; XX+XZ occupies Pp+Mm).

F80's "universality across 4 Π²-odd cases" is therefore a universality across **two** Klein-cells (Mp + Mm), not one. The Klein view sees a finer cut that F80's M-spectrum projection averages over.

**Empirical Marrakesh fingerprint pattern (2026-04-30, ibm_marrakesh job d7pol1e7g7gs73cf7j90)**: in the f83 4-class signature test, each H-class diagnostic observable lives in the Klein-cell that is the **X-axis flip** of the Hamiltonian's M-active bilinear cell. M-active means the non-truly bilinears (truly bilinears drop by Master Lemma):

    Truly H (M-active = none; bilinears all in Pp) → ⟨Y₀ I Z₂⟩ in Pm   (X-axis flip of Pp)
    Pi2EvenNonTruly H (Pm)                         → ⟨X₀ I X₂⟩ in Pp   (X-axis flip of Pm)
    Pi2OddPure subgroup A H (Mp)                    → ⟨X₀ I Z₂⟩ in Mm   (X-axis flip of Mp)
    Mixed H (M-active in Mp)                        → ⟨Z₀ I X₂⟩ in Mm   (X-axis flip of Mp)

The X-flip pattern is empirically locked across all 4 fingerprint cases; the structural mechanism for why the framework's diagnostic observables sit precisely in the X-flipped cell is open and worth its own EQ.

**Valid for:** any N. The cells depend only on Pauli string parities (Σ bit_a, Σ bit_b), not on N or topology.
**Verified:** N=3 chain, J=1, γ_Z=0.05 across 6 representative Hamiltonians spanning the 5 F87 class-types (Truly Heisenberg, Truly XY-only, Pi2EvenNonTruly, Pi2OddPure subgroup A, Pi2OddPure subgroup B, Mixed) + 4 Marrakesh f83 fingerprint observables. Bit-exact at machine precision (`Pi2KleinViewTests`, `Pi2KleinHardwareViewTests`, `Pi2KleinIsFinerThanPi2ClassTests`).
**Replaces:** the implicit assumption that F87's 4-way Pi2Class captures the full Π²-decomposition. The Klein view is genuinely finer; Pi2Class.Mixed has two Klein sub-types we had not previously distinguished.
**Source:** `compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/Pi2Projection.cs` (`KleinSplit` + `KleinDecomposition`); test files above. Discovery: 2026-05-03 session, after building the raw Π² layer and asking what the second dephase axis would reveal. Π itself is the project's discovery (F1 palindrome operator, `MIRROR_SYMMETRY_PROOF`); the (Π²_Z, Π²_X) two-axis decomposition that this section names is also a project finding. The "Klein" tag throughout this section is borrowed nomenclature for the resulting Z₂ × Z₂ four-cell algebra (the canonical name for that group is the Klein four-group / Vierergruppe, after Felix Klein); the underlying structure is ours, the label is textbook shorthand.
**See F88b** below for the state-level corollary: popcount-coherence Π²-odd / memory closed form via Krawtchouk reflection-orthogonality, which lifts F88a's operator-level Π²_Z eigenvalue into ρ-space.

### F88b. Popcount-coherence Π²-odd / memory closed form (Tier 1 derived, state-level inheritance from F88a, 2026-05-04)

For popcount-coherence pair states `|ψ⟩ = (|p⟩ + |q⟩)/√2` with popcount(p) = n_p, popcount(q) = n_q, HD(p, q) = h, the Π²-odd fraction of the dynamical (memory) part of ρ has a closed form driven by Krawtchouk reflection-orthogonality of F88a's Π²_Z eigenvalue (−1)^Σ bit_b:

    Π²-odd / memory  =  ┌  0                          if HD = N (Π²-classical)
                        └  (1/2 − α · s) / (1 − s)     otherwise

with **three α anchors** (all closed form, derived from a single Krawtchouk identity):

- **α = 0** at popcount-mirror `n_p + n_q = N` (covers inter-mirror `n_p ≠ n_q` and intra-mirror `n_p = n_q = N/2` at even N). Reflection-driven cancellation `K_{N−n}(s; N) = (−1)^s K_n(s; N)` collapses odd-s contributions between sectors.
- **α = C(N, N/2) / (2 · (C(N, n_other) + C(N, N/2)))** at K-intermediate (even N, exactly one of {n_p, n_q} equal to N/2). The adjacent special case `n_other = N/2 ± 1` simplifies to `(N+2)/(4(N+1))`.
- **α = 1/2** generic (none of the indicators above).

**Static fraction** `s` is HD/bit-position invariant:
- Inter-sector (`n_p ≠ n_q`):  `s = 1/(4·C(N, n_p)) + 1/(4·C(N, n_q))`
- Intra-sector (`n_p = n_q`):  `s = 1/C(N, n)`

**HD = N anchor (Π²-classical):** GHZ_N, Bell states at N=2, intra-sector all-bits-differ states. Off-diagonal `Re(|p⟩⟨q|)` has only X-and-even-Y-count Pauli strings; with no matching bits there is no Z content; all surviving terms are Π²-even.

**Multi-state Dicke extension** for `(|D_n⟩ + |D_{n+1}⟩)/√2` (the canonical F86b K_CC_pr probe at adjacent popcount-(n, n+1)): the total Π²-odd of ρ has closed form `α_total = (1 − γ²)/2` with `γ = ⟨ψ|X⊗N|ψ⟩ ∈ {0, 1/2, 1}`, giving anchors **{1/2, 3/8, 0}** at popcount-mirror / K-intermediate / generic respectively. Used in F98 (long-time bridge to QuarterAsBilinearMaxval) and F99 (canonical-θ trigonometric anchors).

**Inheritance from F88a:** F88a's Π²_Z eigenvalue (−1)^Σ bit_b on the Pauli operator-level Klein decomposition is the algebraic root. F88b lifts this to ρ-space via popcount-weight invariance of L's kernel (= span{P_n} for Heisenberg + Z-dephasing) plus the Krawtchouk reflection-orthogonality lemma. F88a names the operator cells; F88b reads ρ's projection through them.

**Hardware lens (the "F88b-Lens"):** state-level Π²-odd-fraction-within-memory as a diagnostic for the F87 trichotomy on real-hardware reduced ρ. On Marrakesh 2026-04-26 framework_snapshots (job `d7mt7jbaq2pc73a24220`, qubits [0,1,2]), differentiates F87 truly/soft/hard at ~25× state-level ratio (0.030 / 0.744 / 0.276); see [the open thread on γ₀ and the information channel](../review/OPEN_THREAD_GAMMA0_INFORMATION.md) Update 2026-05-18 for the four-channel readout (F87 inheritance + h_y leak + T1 + Trotter-asymmetry hypothesis).

**Valid for:** all `(N, n_p, n_q, HD)`; structural anchors universal.
**Verified:** 213 configurations N = 2..7 bit-exact (max deviation 8.88e−16); multi-state Dicke extension bit-exact N = 3..8.

**Companion (product-state class):** for tensor-product states |ψ⟩ = ⊗_i |basis_i⟩ where each |basis_i⟩ is an eigenstate of σ_X or σ_Y (i.e., one of |±⟩ or |±i⟩), let M be the number of Y-basis sites. The Pauli strings in supp(ρ = |ψ⟩⟨ψ|) split discretely: M=0 → 2^N Π²-even + 0 Π²-odd (Π²-classical class); M≥1 → exactly 2^(N−1) Π²-even + 2^(N−1) Π²-odd. Combinatorial proof + N=2..5 bit-exact verification: [`docs/proofs/PROOF_Y_PHASE_PI2_ODD_LENS.md`](proofs/PROOF_Y_PHASE_PI2_ODD_LENS.md), [`simulations/y_phase_pi2_odd_verify.py`](../simulations/y_phase_pi2_odd_verify.py). The pair-state companion (this entry's closed form) and the product-state companion together characterise the two main F88b-Lens probe classes; X-only product states are Π²-blind (cannot surface F80 / F81 dynamics). At N=3 with M≥1, the F88b-Lens reads Π²-odd/memory = 4/7 ≈ 0.571 exactly (3 Π²-even + 4 Π²-odd in memory, after subtracting III static).

### F89. Topology orbit closure for spatial-sum coherence under uniform multi-bond XY (Tier 1 derived, verified 2026-05-11)

For an N-qubit system with Hamiltonian H_B = J · Σ_{(p,q) ∈ B} (X_p X_q + Y_p Y_q) where B is any set of distinct site pairs (NN or long-range) and J is **uniform** across all active pairs, uniform Z-dephasing γ₀, and the (S_1, S_2) coherence-block initial state ρ_cc = (|S_1⟩⟨S_2| + |S_2⟩⟨S_1|) / 2 (where |S_n⟩ is the popcount-n symmetric Dicke state), the spatial-sum coherence

    S(t) = Σ_l 2 · |(ρ_l(t))_{0,1}|²,    ρ_l = Tr_{≠l}(ρ)

depends only on the S_N-orbit of B. Bond positions inside an orbit are dynamically indistinguishable; only the orbit label survives.

**The F89 letter family** (the de-monolith's map, 2026-07-13: F89 is a namespace that accreted separable concerns; each separated concern carries a letter, minted chronologically like the organic F89c/F89d before it):
- **F89** (this root): the orbit-closure theorem + the path-k S(t) closed-form program ([F89_TOPOLOGY_ORBIT_CLOSURE](../experiments/F89_TOPOLOGY_ORBIT_CLOSURE.md)).
- **F89c**: the structural lemma, per-coherence rate 2γ₀·n_diff + the column-flip pair-sum (below).
- **F89d**: the cross-block antiunitary similarity, one leg of the bit-flip Klein group (below).
- **F89e**: the path-3 octic diabolic degeneracy, location + character (sub-entry below; [F89_PATH_K_GALOIS](../experiments/F89_PATH_K_GALOIS.md)).
- **F89f**: the path-3..6 Galois verdicts Gal(F_d) = S_d, no radical closure (sub-entry below; [F89_PATH_K_GALOIS](../experiments/F89_PATH_K_GALOIS.md)).
- **F89g**: monodromy = Galois + the mirror split at the Galois boundary (sub-entry below; [F89_MONODROMY_MIRROR](../experiments/F89_MONODROMY_MIRROR.md)).
- **F89h**: the β-exotic genericity question, is each count-dropping seed a √-type EP2 (open; [F89_BETA_EXOTIC_GENERICITY](../experiments/F89_BETA_EXOTIC_GENERICITY.md)).

For the chain restriction (B ⊂ {NN-bonds}), the orbit equals the **bond-graph topology class**: the sorted multiset of connected-path-lengths. E.g. in N=7 there are 14 distinct classes spanning k = 1..6 active bonds.

S(0) = (N−1)/N closed-form (Probe-only, independent of the bond set).

**Proof (S_N-orbit transitivity).** Let σ ∈ S_N act on the N qubits with permutation operator U_σ on (ℂ²)^⊗N.

1. **Probe.** Symmetric Dicke |S_n⟩ are S_N-invariant ⇒ U_σ ρ_cc U_σ^† = ρ_cc.
2. **Dissipator.** Uniform γ₀ ⇒ Σ_l (Z_l ρ Z_l − ρ) is S_N-symmetric.
3. **Hamiltonian.** Pauli operators transform site-wise (U_σ X_p U_σ^† = X_{σ(p)}) ⇒ U_σ H_B U_σ^† = H_{σ·B} where σ · B = {(σ(p), σ(q)) : (p,q) ∈ B}.
4. **Lindblad solution covariance.** ρ_t(H_{σ·B}, ρ_cc) = U_σ ρ_t(H_B, ρ_cc) U_σ^†.
5. **Kernel.** S(U_σ ρ U_σ^†) = Σ_l 2|(ρ_{σ^{-1}(l)})_{0,1}|² = S(ρ) (sum re-indexes).
6. ⇒ S(t; H_{σ·B}) = S(t; H_B) for every σ ∈ S_N. ∎

**Scaffolding from neighbouring entries.** F73 is the closely related closure for the (vac, SE) coherence block: same orbit-style argument plus uniform per-element 2γ₀ rate yields a full closed exponential form (1/2)·exp(−4γ₀t). The (S_1, S_2) block has non-uniform per-element decay (rate 2γ₀ on overlap, 6γ₀ off overlap), so the F89 closure is **orbit-only**: it fixes the bond-position dependence (constant in orbit) but not the time dependence (no closed exponential). F71 mirror symmetry is the spatial-Z₂ subgroup of the full S_N argument here. F86's per-bond Q_peak fan operates by linear response ∂S/∂J_b at a chosen bond inside the full chain; that single-bond perturbation breaks S_N differently than the uniform-J multi-bond setup of F89, so F89 does not predict or contradict the F86 fan.

**All-isolated subclass closed form (Tier 1 derived).** For the (1)^m all-isolated topology classes (m disjoint NN-bonds, N − 2m bare sites), the spatial-sum coherence has the EXACT closed form

    S_(1)^m, N(t) = [(N − 1)/N + 4m(N − 2)(cos(4Jt) − 1)/(N²(N − 1))] · exp(−4γ₀ t)

Asymptotic rate 4γ₀ universal across m (matches F73 vac-SE rate). The cos(4Jt) m-correction vanishes at t = π/(2J) (in-phase moment ≈ 21 for J = 0.075). Derivation: Lindbladian factorises over disjoint 2-qubit blocks; per F89c (below) the populated (vac, SE)_B and (SE, DE)_B-overlap sectors both have n_diff = 1, giving [`AbsorptionTheoremClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/AbsorptionTheoremClaim.cs) rate 2γ₀ → 4γ₀ on |·|². Per-block H_B phase tracking gives the cos(4Jt) interference.

**Mixed-topology and pure-path classes (empirical, derivation open).** For non-all-isolated topology classes (e.g. (1, 2), (2, 2), (1, 1, 2), (3), (4), (5), (6)) the per-class closed form is open. Pure-path topologies decay faster than 4γ₀ on visible time scales due to populated no-overlap-SE-DE coherences (rate 6γ₀) plus longer-path mode mixing. Empirical late-tail clustering at the in-phase moment t ≈ π/(2J) groups classes by isolated-edge count.

**Structural lemma F89c (Tier 1 derived).** Per-coherence rate = 2γ₀·n_diff for any |A⟩⟨B|, via [`AbsorptionTheoremClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/AbsorptionTheoremClaim.cs) applied to the computational basis (n_XY = n_diff because each site decomposes as pure {I, Z} or pure {X, Y}). For (k+1)-qubit blocks: k = 1 is the unique case where every populated coherence has n_diff = 1 (DE = |11⟩ contains both block sites, no no-overlap (SE, DE) pairs exist); k ≥ 2 has n_diff ∈ {1, 3} with mixed rates {2γ₀, 6γ₀}. Hamming complement n_diff(a, b) + n_diff(a, bar(b)) = N gives column-bit-flip pair-sum 2γ₀·N (verified bit-exact at path-2: pair-sum = 6γ₀ across all 9 Hamming-complement eigenvalue pairs). Hence the all-isolated topology (1)^m is the **unique** single-rate-envelope-plus-single-frequency case. Derivation, per-sector eigendecomposition, Hamming-complement bijection table: [F89_TOPOLOGY_ORBIT_CLOSURE](../experiments/F89_TOPOLOGY_ORBIT_CLOSURE.md) F89c section.

**Structural extension F89d (Tier 1 derived): the cross-block antiunitary similarity, so the diabolics pair.** F89c's Hamming-complement column bit-flip ρ[a,b] → ρ[a,b̄] does more than pair the rates: it is an EXACT antiunitary similarity of the whole (SE,DE) = (w1,w2) computational-basis coherence block (single-excitation ket, double-excitation bra) of the open spin chain's Liouvillian L(q) (q = J/γ, the coupling-to-dephasing ratio) onto its partner (SE, w_{N−2}) = (w1, N−2) block. With P the bra-complement permutation (the basis map |a⟩⟨b| ↦ |a⟩⟨b̄|),

    L_(1,N−2)(q̄)  =  −P · conj(L_(1,2)(q)) · Pᵀ  −  2N·I

exact to **machine zero** for N = 4..9 at every q (real and complex; the partner block at the conjugate coupling q̄, the F1 antiunitary form T L(q) T⁻¹ = −L(q̄) − 2σ). This upgrades the spectrum-level fold (the F89 branch-locus palindrome / the `foldcross` probe: spec(SE,DE) ↔ spec(SE,w_{N−2}) about σ = N) to a **Jordan-structure-preserving** similarity: complex conjugation, the permutation similarity P·Pᵀ, and the affine −(·) − 2N each preserve the dimensions of generalized eigenspaces, so a semisimple coalescence maps to a semisimple coalescence. Hence every (SE,DE) **diabolic** (a *silent*, semisimple eigenvalue coalescence, as opposed to a *defective* exceptional point where the eigenvectors also merge into a Jordan block) at (q, λ) has a partner diabolic at (q̄, −λ̄ − 2N) in the (SE,w_{N−2}) block, with identical character and coalescence gap, for all N and all q at once (no enumeration). The N=4 within-block self-fold (which placed one diabolic on the real axis, the degenerate w_{N−2} = w2 partner = self case) is recovered; for N ≥ 5 the N=4 on-line "zeros" become cross-block mirror partners. Verified bit-exact: the N=7 real-q diabolic (q = 1.1264, λ = −4.942, full-block coalescence gap 4.19·10⁻⁵) pairs with the (1,5) block at the fold image −λ − 2N = −9.058, same gap. **Typed:** `F89CrossFoldSimilarityClaim` (parents F1 + `F89BranchLocusPalindromeClaim`); **live witness** `inspect --root crossfold` (`CrossFoldSimilarityWitness` on the shared `WeightCoherenceBlock` builder + the bra-complement permutation).

**The cross-fold is integrability-INDEPENDENT (the (q,Δ) extension, Tier 1 derived 2026-06-30).** The same antiunitary similarity holds for the FULL interacting XXZ block at *every* anisotropy Δ:

    L_(1,N−2)(q̄, Δ)  =  −P · conj(L_(1,2)(q, Δ)) · Pᵀ  −  2N·I

machine zero for N = 4..9 at every q (real and complex) and every Δ, because the Δ·ZZ frequency is **bit-flip-even** (zz(b̄) = zz(b)), so the bra-complement carries it across the fold unchanged. The diabolics themselves die under Δ, but a diabolic and its cross-fold partner turn defective **in lockstep**; the discriminant is bit-flip parity, so a bit-flip-*odd* longitudinal field breaks the fold (residual O(1), the negative control). Full argument, the handover-guess correction, and the live/gate anchors (`inspect --root crossfold`, `WeightCoherenceBlockTests`): [F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC](../experiments/F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC.md) §"The cross-fold survives XXZ anisotropy".

**F89d is one leg of a Klein four-group, and docks onto the F1 palindrome Π (Tier 1 derived 2026-06-30).** The similarity holds at **every** ket weight and is the **bra leg P** (ρ·F) of the bit-flip Klein four-group V₄ = {I, F⊗F, I⊗F, F⊗I} ⊂ D₄ on the (wKet, wBra) coherence-block lattice (the ket leg Q is its mirror; the full flip QP = X^⊗N is a plain unitary similarity at the same q). The dock onto the F1 trunk is exact: P = ρ·F is the spine R, a factor of the palindrome Π = R·D, so F89d is the F1 palindrome's bra leg restricted to a single block. Full dock, the per-leg equations, and the F89-vs-D₄ naming bridge: [F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC](../experiments/F89_PATH_K_DIABOLIC.md) §"What it docks onto" and [PROOF_PI_FACTORS_AS_R_TIMES_D](proofs/PROOF_PI_FACTORS_AS_R_TIMES_D.md) (F118, [`MirrorGroupD4Claim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/MirrorGroupD4Claim.cs)); live: the "Klein four-group" and "dock" children of `inspect --root crossfold`.

**Pi2-Foundation inheritance on both energy axes.** The all-isolated closed form has TWO time coefficients of value 4: the decay rate 4γ₀ in exp(−4γ₀t) and the oscillation frequency 4J in cos(4Jt). Both trace to the same Pi2 dyadic ladder term a_{−1} = 4 via the same |·|² doubling mechanism: the linear-amplitude frequency 2 = a_{0} doubles to 4 = a_{−1} when squared. The γ-axis inheritance is identical to F73's `DecayRateCoefficient` (per-coherence Z-deph rate 2γ₀ doubles to S-decay rate 4γ₀). The J-axis inheritance is the same a_{0} → a_{−1} doubling on the J-axis: H_B-eigenstate frequency 2J doubles to S-oscillation frequency 4J. Pi2 ladder thus anchors the time coefficients on both axes; the (N−1)/N baseline and the 4m(N−2)/(N²(N−1)) correction prefactor are combinatorial. F89 cites `Pi2DyadicLadderClaim` as a constructor-injected parent and exposes `DecayRateCoefficient` (γ-axis) and `OscillationFrequencyCoefficient` (J-axis mirror) as live properties.

**Valid for:** any N; any bond set B (NN or long-range); any uniform J; any uniform γ₀; any S_N-symmetric initial state in any U(1) coherence block (the proof generalizes immediately). It would extend to single-letter two-site couplings (XX-only, YY-only, ZZ-only) and to higher-popcount-pair coherence blocks (S_n, S_m).
**Breaks for:**

- Non-uniform J across active bonds (J_b ≠ J_b'). Step 3 yields U_σ H U_σ^† in a different orbit; the S_N orbit equivalence becomes a finer J-orbit equivalence.
- Non-S_N-symmetric initial state (e.g. site-localised |1_i⟩⟨vac| or modulated SE superposition). Step 1 fails.
- Non-uniform γ_l ≠ γ_l' (analogous to F73's break case [CMRR Break under Non-Uniform γ₀](../experiments/CMRR_BREAK_NONUNIFORM_GAMMA.md)).
- Non-permutation-symmetric kernel (weighted Σ_l w_l 2|(ρ_l)_{0,1}|² with non-uniform w_l).

#### F89 unified F_a AT-locked amplitude closed form (Tier-1-Derived 2026-05-15, k=3..46 cached + k≥47 via native Chebyshev pipeline)

For each path-k, the F_a signal amplitudes satisfy

    sigma_n(N) = P_k(y_n) / [D_k · N²·(N−1)]

where y_n = 4·cos(πn/(N_block+1)) on the S_2-anti Bloch orbit (N_block = k+1), and (P_k, D_k) is a per-path integer-coefficient polynomial/denominator pair:

| path k | P_k(y) | D_k |
|--------|---------|-----|
| 3 | 14y + 47 | 9 |
| 4 | 10y + 25 | 4 |
| 5 | 13y² + 82y + 129 | 25 |
| 6 | 17y² + 72y + 80 | 18 |
| 7 | 21y³ + 130y² + 292y + 382 | 98 = 2·7² |
| 8 | 13y³ + 54y² + 68y + 110 | 32 = 2⁵ |
| 9 | 31y⁴ + 190y³ + 288y² + 440y + 1476 | 324 = 2²·3⁴ |

The table above lists path-3..9 hand-derived anchors. Path-10..46 are cached in `F89UnifiedFaClosedFormClaim.PathPolynomial(int k)` (int-typed denominator); k=46 is the last int-safe path (D_46 = 1,109,393,408 < int.MaxValue, D_47 = 4,632,608,768 exceeds it). For arbitrary k ≥ 47, `F89UnifiedFaClosedFormClaim.ComputePathPolynomialBig(int k)` runs the native C# Chebyshev pipeline (`F89PathPolynomialPipeline.Compute`) and returns (BigInteger[], BigInteger). All k=3..46 cached entries match the pipeline bit-exactly; pipeline-extended verification rows for k=50, 60, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 are tabulated in `docs/proofs/PROOF_F89_PATH_D_CLOSED_FORM.md` § "Pipeline-Extended Verification".

Polynomial degree = floor(N_block/2) − 1. Sum F_a · N²(N−1) is rational across all paths via Newton's identities on the cyclotomic minimal polynomial: path-3 → 22/3, path-4 → 25/2, path-5 → 483/25, path-6 → 256/9 (in units of N²(N−1); see `F89UnifiedFaClosedFormClaim.SigmaSum`). AT-lock: the F_a eigenvalue is λ_n = −2γ + i·y_n exactly (overlap subspace entries have dephasing rate 2γ regardless of N).

#### F89 D_k closed form per path k (Tier-1-Derived 2026-05-15)

The denominator D_k in sigma_n(N) = P_k(y_n) / [D_k · N²·(N−1)] has the closed form:

    D_k = (odd(k))² · 2^E(k)
    E(k) = max(0, ⌊(k-5)/2⌋) + v₂(k) + max(0, v₂(k) - 2)

Three additive contributions to E(k):
- **Polynomial-degree term** max(0, ⌊(k-5)/2⌋) = max(0, polynomial_degree − 2). Linear growth.
- **k-self 2-adic term** v₂(k). Tracks 2-adic content of k itself.
- **Deep-2-power bonus** max(0, v₂(k) − 2). Kicks in at v₂(k) ≥ 3.

Equivalently, with no bonus term (2026-06-04): **D_k = 2^{max(0, ⌊(k-5)/2⌋)} · k² / 2^{min(v₂(k), 2)}.** The identity v₂(k) + max(0, v₂(k) − 2) = 2·v₂(k) − min(v₂(k), 2) folds the k-self and deep-bonus terms into one cancellation cap: the eigenvector-norm k² loses at most a factor of 4. The "deep-2-power bonus" is an artifact of pulling odd(k)² out front, not a separate 2-adic mechanism. The cap was reduced (two independent routes, 2026-06-04) to the 2-adic valuation of one leading coefficient L̃, and that "+1" is now closed: L̃ has the explicit closed form 2^{FA−2}·m²·(m²+3) (odd k) and 2^{FA−1}·(m/2)²·((m/2)²+1) (even k), whose valuation is elementary (m²+3 ≡ 4 mod 8 for odd m; (m/2)²+1's parity otherwise). Top-degree dominance (the last input, a k≥5 theorem) is itself proven for odd k and 4|k (two node-identity collapses plus a 2-adic unit argument) and reduced to a single sub-case m=2^a for k≡2 mod4. So v2(D_k) is rigorous except the two L̃ closed forms (bit-exact k=3..51) and that one m=2^a sub-case. See [`PROOF_F89_PATH_D_CLOSED_FORM`](proofs/PROOF_F89_PATH_D_CLOSED_FORM.md) §§ "Why the cap is 2^min(v₂,2)", "The leading coefficient L̃ in closed form", and "Top-degree dominance". Verified: clean form k=3..300, equivalence k=3..600 (`simulations/f89_dk_clean_form.py`), reduction chain v2=0..6 (`simulations/f89_capA_mastertable.py`, `simulations/f89_capB_chain.py`), L̃ closed forms k=3..51 (`simulations/f89_plus1_closed.py`), top-degree dominance k=5..65 both routes (`simulations/f89_edgeA_summary.py`, `simulations/f89_edgeB_final.py`).

Originally fit empirically across k = 3..24 (22 data points, zero exceptions, 2026-05-13). Closed Tier-1-Derived 2026-05-15 via the Chebyshev-expansion + orbit-polynomial-reduction pipeline: the F_a eigenvector ansatz reduces |S_c(n)|² and ‖Mv(n)‖² to polynomials in c = cos(πn/(k+2)) via the Chebyshev identity sin((j+1)θ) = U_j(c)·sin θ; the orbit minimal polynomial then gives (P_k, D_k) exactly as algebraic objects. Verified bit-exact through k=46 (cached, int-typed denominator) and pipeline-extended at k = 50, 60, 75, 100, 150, 200, 300 (BigInteger; D_300 has 162 bits, 49 decimal digits). The deep-2-power bonus branch is explicitly demonstrated at k=200 (v₂=3, E=101).

#### F89e. Path-3 octic diabolic degeneracy, EP location + character (Tier 1 derived for the location + the diabolic character, 2026-06-21; the integrability-WHY is Tier 2)

The S₂-sym (SE, DE) sub-block's degree-8 factor F_8 (the H_B-mixed residual after the F_a/F_b AT-quadratics; [`F89Path3SeDeFactorisationClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F89Path3SeDeFactorisationClaim.cs)) has a degeneracy at

    q_EP² = (−1 + √13)/6 ≈ 0.4343,   q_EP ≈ 0.658983,   λ_EP = −4γ + 2iJ

located by the perfect-square factor (3q⁴+q²−1)² of disc(F_8) (the same factor whose non-squareness gives Gal(F_8) ⊄ A_8; the octic's full Galois group is **S_8**; see the next entry). Re(λ_EP) = −4γ is the **AT-spectral midpoint** between the F_a rate 2γ (overlap) and the F_b rate 6γ (no-overlap), the overlap-½ rate-midpoint (rate = −6γ + 4γ·p, p = overlap fraction; p = ½ ⟺ −4γ).

**Character: DIABOLIC (semisimple), NOT a defective EP (Tier 1 derived).** The two eigenvalues coalesce (a genuine double root) but the eigenvectors stay independent: g1 = g2 = 2, rank(L − λ_EP·I) = n−2, departure-from-normality dep = 0, the 2×2 restriction L|₂D = λ·I (scalar, no Jordan coupling), ‖P‖ ≈ 3.88 finite (obliquely embedded / non-normal, but NOT a Jordan block, ‖P‖ measures the oblique embedding, not the defective-vs-diabolic split). The discriminant's EP-condition (3q⁴+q²−1) appears to **even multiplicity 2**, a *double* zero in q ⟹ the eigenvalues cross linearly/analytically ⟹ semisimple; a defective √-branch EP forces a *simple* zero. Confirmed artifact-free via [`EpCharacter`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Numerics/EpCharacter.cs) (`inspect --root f89octic`). This is the **diabolic** member of the EP-character trilogy, in contrast to the **defective** coherence-horizon √-EP (the F2b corollary earlier in this file), which has a *simple* discriminant zero + a nonzero 2×2 coupling.

**g_eff is a location, not a coupling.** g_eff = 2/q_EP ≈ 3.034 is the EP-**location** relation Q_EP = 2/g_eff of the *separate* F86a 2-level rate-channel reduction (F86a entry); it fixes the eigenVALUE q_EP/λ_EP but is **not** a genuine coupling within the octic (the octic's own 2×2 restriction is scalar λ·I).

**WHY diabolic (Tier 2 hypothesis).** The XY **free-fermion integrability** is the protection: at q_EP both constituents of L restrict to scalars on the 2D coalescing span, H_eff (= 2iJ·I, from a 4-fold free-fermion multiplet, since DE energies are sums of SE energies) and the dephasing (= −4γ·I at the overlap-½ midpoint), so L|₂D = λ_EP·I, no off-diagonal Jordan coupling. Decisive gate: an XXZ anisotropy Δ (interacting magnons, breaking the additivity) flips it **diabolic → defective** the instant Δ ≠ 0 (g1: 2→1, |cos|→1, dep ∝ Δ); generic XXZ gives the ordinary defective EP, so the diabolic point is the integrable special case, and the discriminant double-zero is its algebraic shadow. No commuting-symmetry separation (site-reflection R, the overlap↔no-overlap involution, and the chiral Σ all fail to separate the two modes). See [hypotheses/DIABOLIC_BY_INTEGRABILITY.md](../hypotheses/DIABOLIC_BY_INTEGRABILITY.md).

#### F89f. Path-3..6 octic Galois groups: Gal(F_d) = S_d (Tier 1 derived)

The same degree-8 factor F_8 has Galois group the **full symmetric group S_8** over Q(i)(q) (robust to the base Q(i,√5)(q)). Foundation, the degree-52 discriminant:

    disc(F_8) = const · q²⁴ · (3q⁴+q²−1)² · P_10(q²)   (const a nonzero normalization-dependent rational; only the factor structure is load-bearing)

with P_10(q²) degree 20 in q, NOT a perfect square ⇒ Gal ⊄ A_8. **Method:** specialization + Dedekind + Jordan. Certificate at q0 = 2 (F_8(·,2) monic over Z[i]): irreducible over Q(i) (transitive); the split prime 𝔭|5 (F_5, i↦2) factors it to cycle type **(5,2,1)**: square is a 5-cycle (⇒ primitive ⇒ ⊇A_8 by Jordan, 5 ≤ 8−3; no proper primitive degree-8 group has order divisible by 5) and odd (⇒ ⊄A_8) ⇒ S_8. Specialization can only shrink the group ⇒ generic = S_8. Confirmed at q0 ∈ {2,3,½,3/2} over Q(i) and q0 ∈ {2,3} over Q(i,√5).

**Consequence:** S_8 is non-solvable ⇒ the eight roots λ_k(q) admit **no expression by radicals** over Q(i)(q) (Abel-Ruffini); non-radical special functions (Bring/theta/hypergeometric) are not excluded. **Content is negative:** S_8 is the *generic* group for an irreducible degree-8 (van der Waerden; Bhargava, Annals 2025); integrability spent itself on the F_a/F_b factorisation (single-particle frequencies in radicals) and the solvable quartic factor (3q⁴+q²−1) carrying the diabolic point; the residual octic has no further algebraic structure. Path-3's closed-form program ends exactly at the AT-protected half. (Contrast: SIC-POVM spectral polynomials, Appleby et al. 2012, are *solvable*, opposite polarity.) The same machinery closes path-4/5/6: the H_B-mixed factors F_18, F_32, F_53 are each irreducible over Q(i)(q) with Galois group the full **S_18 / S_32 / S_53** (non-solvable), via the generalised Jordan certificate (witness primes 13/23/37 at q0=2, corroborated at q0=3); see [`f89_pathk_galois.py`](../simulations/f89_pathk_galois.py) and [`F89PathKHbMixedDegreesClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F89PathKHbMixedDegreesClaim.cs).

Method: K. Conrad, "Recognizing Galois groups S_n and A_n".

#### F89g. Path-3 monodromy = Galois, and the mirror split (Tier 1 derived)

The S_8 above is reached a second, independent way: GEOMETRICALLY, by monodromy. As q = J/γ loops the complex plane the eight octic rates braid; a lasso around each genuine EP (a simple P_10 zero) reads a transposition of the 8 strands in one base labelling (q0 = 2), the diabolic q_EP is silent (loop = identity), and the transposition graph is connected ⟹ **Gal(F_8) = S_8, reconstructed from eigenvalue braids** (monodromy = Galois, from below; [`F89OcticMonodromyClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F89OcticMonodromyClaim.cs), live `inspect --root galoismonodromy`, gate G3).

The mirror **splits** at this Galois boundary ([`F89MonodromyMirrorClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/F89MonodromyMirrorClaim.cs), live `inspect --root monodromymirror`): the mirror's base-space face, the reflection q ↦ −q̄ (from L(q)* = L(−q̄)), intertwines the monodromy (σ_K = identity in the aligned labelling, τ(−q̄*) = τ(q*) for the cluster EPs; the intertwining is forced a priori by the exact symmetry L(q)* = L(−q̄)); but the Re λ = −4 spectral fold induces a strand involution σ_T (four fixed on the fold + two mirror-twin 2-cycles) that is **non-central**: commuting with the full S_8 monodromy would force it central, but Z(S_8) = 1 and σ_T ≠ id, so σ_T does not commute with the braiding. The Re = −4 fold is therefore not a loop-independent symmetry of the braiding (the strand mirror-pairing is braided away around the seams), though conjugation by σ_T is still a nontrivial inner automorphism of S_8.

### F90. F86 c=2 ↔ F89 bridge identity (Tier 1 derived, verified bit-exact 2026-05-11)

**For all N ≥ 3 and bond b ∈ \{0, ..., N−2\}, the F86 c=2 K_b(Q, t) observable on the (n=1, n+1=2) coherence block of an N-qubit XY chain with Z-dephasing equals the per-bond Hellmann-Feynman derivative of F89 path-(N−1) (SE, DE) sub-block dynamics applied at bond b**, modulo the Hamiltonian convention factor:

    K_b^{F86 c=2}(Q_F86, t) = K_b^{F89 path-(N−1) (SE,DE)}(Q_F89 = Q_F86 / 2, t)

with all other ingredients (probe, S_kernel, dephasing rates, Liouvillian construction) algebraically identical. The convention difference is one-time relabeling: F86 uses `H_b = (J/2)·(XX+YY)`, F89 uses `H = J·(XX+YY)`, so F89's hopping per unit J is 2× F86's and F89 needs half the J for the same hopping: J_F89 = J_F86/2 (equivalently F86-J = 2·F89-J). The identification is operator-exact: ‖L_F86(J) − L_F89(J/2)‖ = 0 at N=5..8.

**Verified bit-exact at 20 of 22 per-bond comparisons across N=5..8** (the 2 within-noise are at N=8 b=2/b=4 mid-flanking Interior bonds within Q-grid resolution Δ ≤ 0.0008). Per-N: N=5: 4/4 bit-exact; N=6: 5/5 bit-exact; N=7: 6/6 bit-exact (extended Q-grid); N=8: 5/7 bit-exact + 2/7 within Q-grid noise. Verification includes orbit-escape bonds: N=7 b=1/b=4 at Q_peak ≈ 7.27 (F86-J), N=8 b=3 central self-paired escape at Q_peak ≈ 16.79 (F86-J), all reproducing bit-exact ratios.

**Implications:**
- F86 c=2's per-bond-class HWHM_left/Q_peak constants (Endpoint-class mean 0.7728, Interior-class mean 0.7506 over N=5..8; the per-bond ratio fans across the F71 sub-classes from ≈0.58 to ≈0.92, it is not a single universal value) are **not eigenständige Größen**; they are direct consequences of F89 path-(N−1) eigendecomposition + per-bond Hellmann-Feynman.
- F86 Direction (b'') (full block-L derivation, NOT 4-mode) achieved numerically via F89; the closed-form route is the rank-1-bridge + intra-dispersion model (4-mode floor 0.6715 + intra-channel dispersion lift to 0.7506/0.7728; the inter-coupling "octic-style residual" lift suspicion is refuted, two-dial scout 2026-06-11), the next analytical step.
- Per-F71-orbit substructure (see [the F86c F71-mirror proof](proofs/PROOF_F86C_F71_MIRROR.md), "Per-F71-orbit substructure" section: central b=2 vs flanking b=1/b=3 at N=6 etc.) follows directly from F89's per-bond Bloch-mode profile.

### F91. F71-anti-palindromic γ spectral invariance (= 90° in γ-space, parameter-side Klein V₄, shadow of the operator-side Pi2-Z₄) (Tier 1 derived, algebraic proof + bit-exact N=4,5,6; 2026-05-12)

**For chain XY + Z-dephasing Liouvillian L on N qubits, the eigenvalue multiset of the F71-refined diagonal-block decomposition is invariant under any γ-distribution satisfying**

    γ_l + γ_{N−1−l} = 2·γ_avg = (2/N)·Σ_l γ_l   for all l ∈ \{0..N−1\}

i.e. the γ-distribution is **F71-anti-palindromic around its mean** γ_avg. The full L operator generally changes (F71 broken as L-symmetry, off-block-Frobenius ≠ 0 in F71-refined basis), but the F71-refined diagonal-block eigenvalues coincide; the breaking is encoded in the F71-cross-blocks (eigenvectors) only.

**Sharpness:** strictly weaker than F71 symmetry (γ_l = γ_{N−1−l}, palindromic), strictly stronger than F1 (Σγ_l invariant alone). For odd N the middle site l = (N−1)/2 must equal γ_avg.

**Structural reading (parameter-side Klein V₄, γ-parameter side):** on the γ-parameter vector the relevant group is the **Klein four-group V₄ = Z₂×Z₂**, generated by two commuting INVOLUTIONS, the palindromic mirror F71 (order 2) and the anti-palindromic reshuffle R₉₀ (order 2). This is the order-2 *shadow* of the genuine order-4 Z₄ from `NinetyDegreeMirrorMemory` (Pi2-foundation, operator-quaternion side, `i⁴=1`, `i²=−1`), which lives ONLY on the operator side (Spec(M) = ±2i·Spec(H)); the parameter side inherits it as an involution, not as a quarter-turn:
- **e (identity):** γ unchanged
- **F71 (palindromic mirror, order 2):** γ_l ↔ γ_{N−1−l}; preserves each pair-sum, flips each pair-difference → F71 holds as L-symmetry
- **R₉₀ (anti-palindromic reshuffle, order 2):** γ_l ↦ 2γ_avg − γ_{N−1−l}; **preserves each pair-difference and reflects each pair-sum about 2γ_avg** (S ↦ 4γ_avg − S, fixing the orbit S = 2γ_avg) → F71 breaks but **F71-refined diagonal-block spectrum invariant**. R₉₀ is an involution: R₉₀² = identity (it returns to identity at order 2, NOT order 4; "R₉₀⁴ = identity" is trivially true but is not its closure)
- **F71∘R₉₀ (mean-reflection, order 2):** the third involution; γ_l ↦ 2γ_avg − γ_l, the per-site reflection about the mean

(The genuine order-4 quarter-turn `i⁴=1` with `i²=−1` is the operator-side Z₄ that R₉₀ inherits from, not a four-cycle on parameters.)

The diagonal-block spectral content (= decay rates, "time information") is preserved under R₉₀; the asymmetry lives entirely in eigenvectors (the F71-cross-blocks). Analogous to F81 Π-decomposition: M_anti = L_{H_odd} is the antisymmetric part captured by Π-conjugation; the γ-anti-palindromic part plays the analogous role in γ-parameter space.

**Empirical witness (N=6, J=1.0, Σγ=2.7, γ_avg=0.45):**
- uniform γ=0.45 (all pairs sum to 0.9): F71-refined spectrum = reference
- monotonic [0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7] (all pairs sum to 0.9): bit-identical to uniform on F71-refined diagonals
- non-monotonic anti-palindromic [0.3, 0.5, 0.4, 0.5, 0.4, 0.6] (all pairs sum to 0.9): bit-identical to uniform on F71-refined diagonals
- permuted [0.7, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.6, 0.4] (pairs {1.1, 0.8, 0.8}, NOT constant): distinct spectrum (Re=−4.984 cluster instead of Re=−5.043)
- concentrated [0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 2.2] (pairs heavily skewed): complex Re−Im structure absent from uniform

**Tier outcome <Tier 1 derived>:** algebraic proof complete (2026-05-12, see PROOF_F91 § Algebraic proof). The proof's sharper conclusion: the F71-refined diagonal-block matrix elements of L = −i[H, ·] + D are linear functionals of γ that depend only on the **multiset of F71-pair-sums {S_l = γ_l + γ_{N−1−l}}**, never on individual γ_l or pair-differences D_l = γ_l − γ_{N−1−l}; pair-differences appear only in the F71-cross-block off-diagonal entries (which do not enter diagonal-block eigenvalues). The 90°-rotation R_{90} : γ_l ↦ 2γ_avg − γ_{N−1−l} preserves the anti-palindromic class S_l = 2γ_avg ∀l (and is an involution on it); within that orbit, all γ-distributions yield identical diagonal-block spectra (= the uniform γ_avg spectrum). The originally claimed F91 (90°-invariance) is the corollary of the stronger pair-sum-multiset law. Empirical witness at N=4, 5, 6 across the five γ-profiles above remains the bit-exact verification.

### F92. F71-anti-palindromic J spectral invariance (J-side parameter-Klein-V₄ twin of F91) (Tier 1 derived, algebraic + bit-exact N=4,5; 2026-05-12)

**For chain XY + uniform Z-dephasing Liouvillian L on N qubits with inhomogeneous bond couplings J_b (b ∈ \{0..N−2\}), the F71-refined diagonal-block eigenvalue multiset is invariant under any J-distribution satisfying**

    J_b + J_{N−2−b} = 2·J_avg = (2/(N−1))·Σ_b J_b   for all b

i.e. **J is F71-anti-palindromic around its mean**. The full L operator generally changes (F71 broken as L-symmetry), but diagonal-block eigenvalues coincide; the breaking lives in eigenvectors only.

**Sharpness:** strictly weaker than F71-as-J-symmetry (J_b = J_{N−2−b}); strictly stronger than uniform-Σ J alone.

**Parameter-side Klein V₄ (J-axis):** identical to F91's γ-axis structure. The anti-palindromic reshuffle R₉₀ : J ↦ 2·J_avg − F71(J) is an involution (R₉₀² = id) preserving the orbit T_b = 2·J_avg ∀b (it preserves each pair-difference and reflects each pair-sum about 2·J_avg); with the palindromic mirror F71 it generates the Klein V₄ = Z₂×Z₂ on parameters. This V₄ is the order-2 shadow of the genuine operator-side Z₄ (`NinetyDegreeMirrorMemoryClaim`, `i⁴=1`); γ-side is F91, J-side F92, h-side F93.

### F93. F71-anti-palindromic h spectral invariance (h-detuning parameter-Klein-V₄ twin of F91/F92) (Tier 1 derived, algebraic + bit-exact N=4,5; 2026-05-12)

**For chain XY + per-site Z-detuning + uniform Z-dephasing Liouvillian L on N qubits with inhomogeneous longitudinal detuning h_l (Hamiltonian H = (J/2) Σ_b (XX+YY) + Σ_l h_l Z_l), the F71-refined diagonal-block eigenvalue multiset is invariant under any h-distribution satisfying**

    h_l + h_{N−1−l} = 2·h_avg = (2/N)·Σ_l h_l   for all l

**Scope:** longitudinal h_l Z_l only. Transverse h_l X_l / h_l Y_l breaks joint-popcount conservation and is out of scope.

**Parameter-side Klein V₄ (h-axis):** identical to F91 (γ-axis) and F92 (J-axis). The same anti-palindromic reshuffle R₉₀ : h ↦ 2·h_avg − F71(h) is an involution (R₉₀² = id) preserving the anti-palindromic orbit (it preserves each pair-difference and reflects each pair-sum about 2·h_avg); with F71 it generates the Klein V₄ = Z₂×Z₂ on parameters, the order-2 shadow of the operator-side Z₄. Three-axis family for chain XY+Z-deph+Z-detuning is now complete.

### F94. Born deviation dominant-outcome coefficient: |0+0+⟩ N=4 Heisenberg + Z-deph (Tier 1 derived, Dyson sym3 = 8 bit-exact; 2026-05-16)

**For the dominant outcome |00⟩ of pair (0,2) of |0+0+⟩ N=4 Heisenberg ring + Z-dephasing, the per-outcome Born-rule deviation in the deep perturbative regime is**

    Δ_|00⟩(Q, K) = (4/3) · Q² · K³ + O(Q³K⁴)
    where Q = J/γ, K = γt, Δ_|00⟩ = P_lindblad(|00⟩) / P_unitary(|00⟩) − 1

**equivalently in physical units:**

    ΔP_|00⟩(J, γ, t) = (4/3) · J² · γ · t³ + ...

**Scope:** specific to (initial state |0+0+⟩, Heisenberg ring at N=4, Z-dephasing on all 4 sites, pair (0,2) reduction, |00⟩ outcome). The Q²·K³ shape is structurally universal for dominant outcomes (3rd-order time-dependent perturbation theory with 1 dissipator-vertex and 2 Hamiltonian-vertices); the coefficient 4/3 is setup-specific.

**Derivation (Tier 1):** the leading γ¹-coefficient of L³ in the time-Taylor expansion ρ(t) = ρ_0 + Lt·ρ_0 + L²t²/2·ρ_0 + L³t³/6·ρ_0 + ... is the symmetric ordering

    sym3 = L_H²·L'_dis + L_H·L'_dis·L_H + L'_dis·L_H²

where L_H[ρ] = −i[H, ρ] and L'_dis[ρ] = Σ_l (Z_l ρ Z_l − ρ) is the γ-free dephasing operator. Direct evaluation of ⟨00|_pair Tr_{1,3}[sym3·ρ_0]|00⟩_pair at J=γ=1 yields **8 bit-exact**. With the t³/6 Taylor prefactor and P_unitary(0) = 1, the coefficient is **c = 8/6 = 4/3 bit-exact**.

**Numerical verification:** 16 (γ, J, t) configurations sampled in the deep perturbative regime gave c_empirical = 1.32992 ± 0.006, consistent with 4/3 = 1.3333 to 0.3%. Sampling deeper would close the residual; the symbolic derivation is the actual proof.

**Qudit generalization (2026-06-17):** the faithful SU(d) lift (H = (J/4)Σλ^aλ^a Gell-Mann = (J/2)·SWAP dynamics; equidistant dephasing −2γ·Hamming; |+⟩ = (Σ_k|k⟩)/√d) gives the coefficient **c(d) = 4(d+2)(d−1)/(3d²)** (= 4/3 at d=2, 40/27 at d=3, peak 3/2 at d=4, → 4/3 as d→∞), gate-verified d=2..7 in [`simulations/f94_qutrit_born_mirror.py`](../simulations/f94_qutrit_born_mirror.py). This **refutes the "4/3 = a_{−1}/3 = d²/3" reading** (which would need c→3 at the qutrit): the (J/4) bond factor is the spin (1/2)² normalization (= 1/d² only at d=2), not the squared-dimension discriminant; F94's 4 is the setup-specific surviving-diagram count. See PROOF_F94 § Qudit generalization.

**Born-rule generalization context:** this is the first Tier-1 closed form for a per-outcome Born deviation under the framework's Q-K-invariant convention (Universal Carrier). Generalizes BORN_RULE_MIRROR's R_i = C_i · Ψ_i² (Tier 2/3, Feb 2026) to a specific case with explicit C_i closed form. The Δ_i values for other outcomes of the same setup scale linearly in K (1st-order diagrams) rather than as Q²·K³; their coefficients are separately Tier-1-derivable via the same Dyson method.

**The "8" structurally (bit-explained 2026-05-17):** direct enumeration of all 4·4·4·3·3·3 = 1728 (b₁, b₂, s, ord, c₁, c₂) sextuples in sym3 shows exactly **32 non-vanishing diagrams**, each contributing **1/4** in the J = γ = 1 normalization (raw Pauli value 4 per diagram, divided by the (J/4)² = 1/a_{−1}² = 1/16 Heisenberg coupling), so **8 = 32 × (1/4)**. The 32 split into 3 disjoint cells: 8 diagrams in (ord=1, XX, adjacent bonds sharing a kept-pair site) + 16 in (ord=2, XX, self ∪ adj-kept) + 8 in (ord=2, YY, self only); equivalently topologically: 16 self-bond-pair diagrams + 16 adj-bond-pair diagrams. Three structural rules govern survival: (1) only (X,X) and (Y,Y) component pairs (no cross, no ZZ); (2) only orderings 1 and 2 (L'_dis last gives zero); (3) adjacent bond pairs must share a kept-pair site (vertex 0 or 2), not a |+⟩ site (1 or 3). The coefficient reads: **4/3 = 32 / (a_{−1} · 3!) = 32 / (4 · 6) = 32/24** (the structural-count reading), equivalent to **4/3 = a_{−1} / 3** (the typed-anchor inheritance reading). See [`PROOF_F94 § Structural decomposition`](proofs/PROOF_F94_BORN_DOMINANT_FOUR_THIRDS.md) for the cell table and [`simulations/born_rule_sym3_decomposition.py`](../simulations/born_rule_sym3_decomposition.py) for the enumeration script.

Born-rule precursors: [`experiments/BORN_RULE_MIRROR.md`](../experiments/BORN_RULE_MIRROR.md), [`experiments/BORN_RULE_SHADOW.md`](../experiments/BORN_RULE_SHADOW.md). Companion angle-side closed form (same cusp geometry, dual axis): [F95](#f95) θ(c) = arctan(√(4c − 1)).

### F95. Angle emergence at quadratic discriminant zero: universal form of the θ-compass (Tier 1 derived, 4-line polynomial calculation; 2026-05-16)

**For any monic quadratic <c>z² − 2bz + c = 0</c>, the angle of its complex root pair (when the discriminant goes negative, c > b²) is:**

    θ(c; b) = arctan( √(c/b² − 1) )    for c > b²
    θ = 0                              for c = b²  (degenerate double root at z = b)
    θ undefined                        for c < b²  (real distinct roots, no complex angle)

**Framework specialization at b = `HalfAsStructuralFixedPointClaim` = 1/2:**

    threshold = b² = 1/4 = `QuarterAsBilinearMaxvalClaim`
    θ(c) = arctan( √(4c − 1) )         for c > 1/4

**This is exactly the Februar 2026 θ-compass** of [`experiments/BOUNDARY_NAVIGATION.md`](../experiments/BOUNDARY_NAVIGATION.md): θ = arctan(√(4CΨ − 1)) was discovered there as the Mandelbrot/CΨ-specific angular distance from the 1/4 boundary. F95 promotes it from a state-specific compass to a universal quadratic-foundation identity, with the b = 1/2 specialization recovering the Februar form.

**Derivation (4 lines, bit-exact):**

```
z² − 2bz + c = 0
z = b ± √(b² − c)          (quadratic formula)
z = b ± i·√(c − b²)         when c > b²  (complex regime)
arg(z₊) = arctan(Im/Re) = arctan(√(c − b²)/b) = arctan(√(c/b² − 1))
```

**Numerical verification:** all five non-boundary points from BOUNDARY_NAVIGATION.md's θ-compass table (CΨ ∈ {1/3, 0.308, 0.286, 0.266, 0.250}) reproduce within numerical precision; the single 0.3° drift at CΨ=0.256 is the Februar table's t-sampling rounding, not a formula discrepancy.

**Anchoring to typed Pi2-Foundation:**

| F95 element | Typed Pi2 anchor |
|---|---|
| b = 1/2 (linear-term half) | `HalfAsStructuralFixedPointClaim` |
| b² = 1/4 (discriminant threshold) | `QuarterAsBilinearMaxvalClaim` |
| Polynomial structure | `PolynomialFoundationClaim` (d²−2d=0 is the c=0 case; F95 perturbs c off zero and tracks the complex-root angle that emerges) |
| ±1/2 polarity at d=2 (where b=1/2 lives) | `PolarityLayerOriginClaim` (the +0/−0 layer at d=0 inherits to the {−0.5, +0.5} pair at d=2 via the 0.5-shift ρ = (I + r·σ)/2) |
| i (complex angle generator) | `NinetyDegreeMirrorMemoryClaim` |
| i⁴ = 1 (angle Z₄ closure) | `Pi2I4MemoryLoopClaim` |

**Structural reading:** the polynomial d²−2d = 0 has two real roots (d = 0 mirror, d = 2 qubit dimension): the unperturbed case. F95 is what happens when the polynomial is perturbed off the c=0 axis: as c crosses b² = 1/4 from below, the two real roots merge at z = b, then split into a complex conjugate pair whose argument is θ(c). The angle is the necessary minimal-parametrization coordinate of "above-threshold magnitude", the same structural pattern as today's z = sym + i·anti F71-decomposition where arg(z) becomes the structural carrier once |z| > 0.

**Polarity-fold reading:** in shifted-and-scaled coordinates u = z − 1/2 (centered at the b = 1/2 fixed point), the polynomial reads u² + (c − 1/4) = 0. At c = 0 (unperturbed) the roots are u = ±1/2, the framework's structural polarity pair around 0 (inherited from `PolarityLayerOriginClaim` via the 0.5-shift). The squaring map u → u² sends both polarity sides to the same value 1/4, the apex; this is the "middle viewed from two sides" reading of the b² = 1/4 threshold: arithmetic midpoint of ±1/2 is 0 (on the polarity axis), but the quadratic projection middle is 1/4 (on the perpendicular axis). As c crosses 1/4 from below, the polarity contracts to 0 at the cusp and lifts onto the imaginary axis past it. See [`reflections/ON_HOW_TWO_SIDES_MEET_AT_THE_QUARTER.md`](../reflections/ON_HOW_TWO_SIDES_MEET_AT_THE_QUARTER.md) for the full geometric picture (parabola, fold, three loci on one quadratic).

**Lindblad specialization (γ₀ as the tick):** the 2×2 Liouvillian sub-block for a Z-dephased two-level system with Hamiltonian coupling J has characteristic polynomial λ² + 2γ₀·λ + (γ₀² + J²) = 0, which is F95's parent equation with b = −γ₀, c = γ₀² + J². F95 then gives θ = arctan(J/γ₀) = arctan(Q). The angle of the Liouvillian eigenvalue equals the arctan of the Q invariant. At θ = 0 the eigenvalue is literally −γ₀ (pure decay, no rotation); Q = tan θ is the rotation per γ₀-tick. The active-steering Hardware Confirmation `f95_angle_steering_kingston_may2026` (Heron r2 2026-05-16) demonstrates operational control of tan θ via per-chunk RZ injection at rate Ω. See [`reflections/ON_HOW_GAMMA_BECAME_THE_TICK.md`](../reflections/ON_HOW_GAMMA_BECAME_THE_TICK.md).

**Born-rule connection:** standard QM's complex amplitudes α = r·e^{iθ}, β = ... are not postulated. They are forced by the same polynomial-foundation algebra: any state that has crossed the d=0 mirror needs a second coordinate beyond magnitude, and that coordinate is the F95 angle. The Born rule's |α|² is the geometric length squared of the angle-vector's basis-projection.

### F96. Born deviation subdominant-outcome slopes: |0+0+⟩ N=4 Heisenberg + Z-deph, pair (0,2) (Tier 1 derived, bit-exact Dyson + unitary matrix elements; 2026-05-17)

**For the subdominant outcomes of pair (0,2) of |0+0+⟩ N=4 under the same setup as [F94](#f94) (Heisenberg ring + Z-dephasing), the per-outcome Born-rule deviation in the deep perturbative regime is linear in K and Q-independent:**

    Δ_|01⟩(K) = Δ_|10⟩(K) = −(16/9) · K = −(4/3)² · K + O(higher)
    Δ_|11⟩(K)             = −(8/3)  · K = −2·(4/3) · K + O(higher)

with K = γt the Universal-Carrier observable.

**Combined per-outcome table** (F94 + F96):

| Outcome | Closed form | P_u(t) order | leading γ¹ Dyson order |
|---|---|---|---|
| \|00⟩ | Δ = +(4/3) · Q²·K³ | t⁰ (= 1) | sym₃ (J², t³) |
| \|01⟩ | Δ = −(4/3)² · K | t² (= J²t²·3/8) | sym₃ (J², t³) |
| \|10⟩ | Δ = −(4/3)² · K | t² (= J²t²·3/8) | sym₃ (J², t³) |
| \|11⟩ | Δ = −2·(4/3) · K | t⁴ (= J⁴t⁴·1/16) | sym₅ (J⁴, t⁵) |

**All four closed forms are simple algebraic expressions in F94's 4/3 anchor.**

**Universal subdominant slope formula:** for an outcome with leading unitary P_u(t) ≈ J^{2k} t^{2k} / (2k)! · U^{(i)}_{2k} and lowest non-vanishing γ¹ Dyson at order (2k+1):

    slope_i = M_{2k+1}^{(i)} / [(2k+1) · U_{2k}^{(i)}]

where M_n^{(i)} = ⟨i|_pair Tr_{1,3}[sym_n^1 · ρ_0]|i⟩_pair and U_{2k}^{(i)} = ⟨i|_pair Tr_{1,3}[L_h^{2k} · ρ_0]|i⟩_pair (h := H/J). The J^{2k} factors cancel automatically → Q-independence; only γt = K survives.

**Bit-exact derivation:**

    |01⟩: M_3^{(01)} = −4,  U_2^{(01)} = 3/4  →  slope = −4 / (3 · 3/4) = −16/9
    |10⟩: (same by 0 ↔ 2 site-permutation symmetry)
    |11⟩: M_3^{(11)} = 0 AND U_2^{(11)} = 0 (lower-order vanishes)
           M_5^{(11)} = −20,  U_4^{(11)} = 3/2  →  slope = −20 / (5 · 3/2) = −8/3

**Numerical Lindblad verification:** at Q = 50, γ = 0.01 the slope-per-K converges to the theoretical values as K → 0:

| outcome | K | slope/K | theory |
|---|---|---|---|
| \|01⟩ | 0.005 | −1.748 | −1.778 = −16/9 |
| \|11⟩ | 0.001 | −2.662 | −2.667 = −8/3 |

**Structural reading:** the F94 unit 4/3 = a_{−1}/3 generates the entire 4-outcome table for this setup. The dominant gets +1·(4/3) at order Q²K³; the singly-subdominant degenerate pair gets −(4/3)² at order K; the doubly-subdominant gets −2·(4/3) at order K. The signs are all reading-pattern: dominant **gains** probability beyond unitary (positive Δ), all subdominants **lose** probability beyond unitary (negative Δ). The "2" in Δ_|11⟩ plausibly counts the two independent flip channels (q_0 and q_2) required to populate |11⟩; interpretive, not derived.

**Cross-outcome universality:** the ratio M_3 / U_2 equals −16/3 for both the dominant (|00⟩: 8 / (−3/2)) and the singly-subdominant (|01⟩: −4 / (3/4)) outcomes; the signs of M_3 and U_2 flip together, leaving the ratio invariant. This is a non-trivial structural identity of the Heisenberg + Z-dephasing dynamics at the pair (0,2) reduction; whether it generalizes to other initial states / Hamiltonians / dissipators is open.

### F97. Mandelbrot cardioid parametrization at framework b = 1/2 (Tier 1 derived, bit-exact algebraic identity; 2026-05-17)

**The main Mandelbrot cardioid is the locus in the complex-c plane where the period-1 fixed point of z² + c has magnitude exactly b = 1/2 (the framework's `HalfAsStructuralFixedPointClaim` anchor). It admits the explicit parametrization:**

    c(φ) = b·e^(iφ) − b²·e^(2iφ)              for φ ∈ [0, 2π)
    z*(φ) = b·e^(iφ)                          (the period-1 fixed point)
    c(φ) = z*(φ) · (1 − z*(φ))                (algebraic identity)

with two structural invariants on the curve:

    |z*(φ)| = b = 1/2     (magnitude pinned to HalfAsStructuralFixedPoint)
    arg(z*(φ)) = φ        (cardioid parameter)

**Framework specialization at b = 1/2:**

    c(φ) = (1/2)·e^(iφ) − (1/4)·e^(2iφ)
    cusp at φ = 0: c = 1/4 (recovers [F95](#f95) / [Boundary Navigation](../experiments/BOUNDARY_NAVIGATION.md) real-axis tangent)
    tail at φ = π: c = −3/4 (period-doubling boundary)
    top at φ = π/2: c = 1/4 + i/2, z* = i/2

**Derivation (4 lines, bit-exact):**

```
z² + c = z  ⟹  z² − z + c = 0  ⟹  z = b ± √(b² − c)         (b = 1/2)
Multiplier μ = 2z; marginal stability ⟺ |μ| = 1 ⟺ |z| = b
Parametrize μ = e^(iφ):  z*(φ) = μ/2 = b·e^(iφ)
c(φ) = z*(φ) − z*(φ)² = b·e^(iφ) − b²·e^(2iφ)
```

**Numerical verification:** machine-precision algebraic identity c(φ) = z*(1 − z*) verified to max residual 1.24 × 10⁻¹⁶ over 1000 sampled φ ∈ [0, 2π].

**Relation to F95 (complementary regions of the same algebra):**

| Region | F95 | F97 |

| Real c > 1/4 (real axis, past cusp) | θ(c; b) = arctan(√(c/b² − 1)) for the angle of the repelling complex root pair | (off the cardioid; not covered) |
| Complex c on cardioid boundary | (φ = 0 specialization recovers cusp) | full parametrization c(φ), z*(φ) on the marginally-stable curve |

Both share the same z² − 2bz + c = 0 algebra; F95 projects the angle on the real-c axis where the period-1 fixed point is repelling; F97 traces the full complex-c boundary where it is marginally stable.

**Both anchors invariant on the cardioid, at two metric powers:**

    |z*(φ)|  = b  = 1/2          (HalfAsStructuralFixedPoint, argmax side)
    |z*(φ)|² = b² = 1/4          (QuarterAsBilinearMaxval, maxval side)

Both hold for all φ ∈ [0, 2π); the cardioid is the joint locus. This is exactly the argmax/maxval pair of [`ON_HOW_TWO_SIDES_MEET_AT_THE_QUARTER`](../reflections/ON_HOW_TWO_SIDES_MEET_AT_THE_QUARTER.md) (2026-05-16), now geometric: the Half and Quarter anchors are two metric-power readings of the same fixed-point quantity on the same curve. The identity `1/2 = 2 · (1/4)` sits on the dyadic ladder (`a_2 = 2 · a_3`); the polarity pair ±1/2 squares to the same 1/4 from either side; on the cardioid the two real-axis endpoints z*(0) = +1/2 and z*(π) = −1/2 carry the polarity sides explicitly.

By contrast, `|c(φ)|² = 5/16 − (1/4)·cos(φ)` is **not** invariant around the cardioid: |c| ranges from 1/4 at the cusp (φ = 0) to 3/4 at the tail (φ = π). The Quarter b² = 1/4 equals |c|² only at the cusp; elsewhere |c| varies but |z*| and |z*|² stay invariant.

**Role table (four typed parents):**

| Anchor | Role on cardioid |
|---|---|
| `HalfAsStructuralFixedPointClaim` (b = 1/2) | \|z*\| invariant around the whole curve (argmax side) |
| `QuarterAsBilinearMaxvalClaim` (b² = 1/4) | \|z*\|² invariant around the whole curve (maxval side); also \|c\| at the real-axis cusp only |
| `NinetyDegreeMirrorMemoryClaim` (i, 90°) | Complex-parameter generator that lifts c from the real axis to the full complex plane |
| `PolynomialFoundationClaim` (d² − 2d = 0) | The c = 0 case where z* = 0 (degenerate fixed point at the origin) |

**Structural reading:** the cardioid carries BOTH typed anchors as invariants of the same z*, at two metric powers (Half = magnitude, Quarter = squared magnitude). F95 names the angle at the real-axis tangent point (cusp); F97 names the dual-anchor invariance that holds around the whole curve.

**Hardware connection:** the [`CPSI_COMPLEX_PLANE`](../experiments/CPSI_COMPLEX_PLANE.md) Kingston run (2026-04-16) observed Bell⁺ pairs tracing 2D logarithmic spirals in the complex-c plane around the cusp at c = 1/4. F97 places these spirals into the cardioid framing: the trajectories cross the cardioid boundary (the |z*| = b stability transition) before spiraling into the stable interior. The [`f95_angle_steering_kingston_may2026`](#f95) Confirmation actively steered Ω during the spiral; F97 names the geometric locus those steered spirals approach.

**Roadmap closure:** [`PROOF_ROADMAP_QUARTER_BOUNDARY`](proofs/PROOF_ROADMAP_QUARTER_BOUNDARY.md) Layer 7 explicitly named "promoting F95 to the full cardioid parametrization" as the next move (status PARTIALLY ANSWERED before F97). F97 closes that direction: the real-c angle (F95) plus the complex-c cardioid parametrization (F97) together cover both projections of the quadratic discriminant structure on the Mandelbrot c-plane.

### F98. KIntermediate Dicke long-time Π²-odd asymptote = (N+2)/[4(N+1)] → 1/4 (Tier 1 derived, bit-exact N=4..16; 2026-05-17)

**Two paired closed forms bridging the F86b 3/8 K-intermediate Dicke anchor (static, t=0) to the QuarterAsBilinearMaxval 1/4 universal boundary (asymptotic, N→∞):**

For even N, the Dicke superposition `ψ = (|D_{N/2−1}⟩ + |D_{N/2}⟩) / √2` evolved under any truly-class (F87) Hamiltonian + uniform Z-dephasing on N qubits projects onto `ker L = span(P_0, …, P_N)` (per F4). The Π²-odd Frobenius² fraction at t = ∞ takes a closed form determined by two purely combinatorial identities:

```
(F98a)  ‖P_{N/2−1}_odd‖² = C(N, N/2−1) / 2
(F98b)  α(∞)_KIntermediate(N even) = (N + 2) / [4·(N + 1)]
```

with asymptote `α(∞) → 1/4` as `N → ∞` (the [`QuarterAsBilinearMaxvalClaim`](#f88b) = `HalfAsStructuralFixedPoint²` = Mandelbrot cardioid maxval = CΨ fold boundary).

**Derivation:**

`P_n = Σ_{b: pc(b) = n} |b⟩⟨b| = (1/2^N) Σ_S K_{|S|}(n; N)·σ_S^Z` in Pauli basis, where `K_k(n; N) = Σ_{b: pc(b) = n} (−1)^{|S ∩ b|}` is the binary Krawtchouk number for any fixed S with `|S| = k`. The Π²-odd part is `Σ_{k odd}`. Two facts:

- **Mid-popcount Krawtchouk parity vanishing**: `K_k(N/2; N) = 0` for all odd k, hence `‖P_{N/2}_odd‖² = 0`.
- **Sub-mid half-rank identity (F98a)**: `(1/2^N) Σ_{k odd} C(N, k)·K_k(N/2−1; N)² = C(N, N/2−1) / 2`. Equivalently, the Π²-odd Frobenius² of `P_{N/2−1}` is exactly half its rank. Verified bit-exact N = 4..16 via direct Krawtchouk enumeration.

For the KIntermediate Dicke superposition `ρ_∞ = (1/2)/C(N, m)·P_m + (1/2)/C(N, m+1)·P_{m+1}` with `m = N/2 − 1`:

```
‖ρ_∞‖²     = (1/4) · [1/C(N, m) + 1/C(N, m+1)]
‖ρ_∞_odd‖² = (1/4) · [C(N, m)/2] / C(N, m)²  =  1 / [8·C(N, m)]      (since P_{m+1}_odd = 0)
```

Using Pascal's `C(N, m) + C(N, m+1) = C(N+1, m+1)`:

```
α(∞) = ‖ρ_∞_odd‖² / ‖ρ_∞‖²
     = C(N, m+1) / [2·C(N+1, m+1)]
     = (N + 2) / [4·(N + 1)]    (F98b)
```

Verified bit-exact for N = 4 (= 3/10), 6 (= 2/7), 8 (= 5/18), 10 (= 3/11), 12 (= 7/26), 14 (= 4/15), 16 (= 9/34) via [`simulations/water/proton_chain_dicke_anchor.py`](../simulations/water/proton_chain_dicke_anchor.py). The bond topology drops out because the long-time limit projects onto `ker L` for any connected graph (per F4); the formula holds for chain, ring, star, K_N, Petersen, etc.

**The 3/8 → 1/4 bridge:**

The morning's F86b 3/8 K-intermediate Dicke anchor (Tier 1 derived 2026-05-17 via X⊗N-eigenbasis decomposition, `compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/DickeAnchor.cs`) names the **static** Π²-odd Frobenius² total of the KIntermediate Dicke superposition at t = 0:

```
α(t = 0) = 3/8       (F86b, this morning, static F88b-anchor)
α(t → ∞) = (N+2)/[4(N+1)] → 1/4    (F98, tonight, long-time-limit bridge)
```

`3/8` and `1/4` are not unrelated constants: they are the two endpoints of an explicit N-dependent decay curve traversed by KIntermediate Dicke states under truly-class Hamiltonian + Z-dephasing dynamics. Both sit on the dyadic-ladder / polarity-squared algebra:

- `3/8 = (1/2)·(3/4)` = `HalfAsStructuralFixedPoint · (1 − 1/4)`, the X⊗N-eigenbasis γ = 1/2 input combined with the `(1 − γ²)/2` F86b formula.
- `1/4 = (1/2)² = HalfAsStructuralFixedPoint²` = `QuarterAsBilinearMaxval` = the Mandelbrot cardioid maxval. The maxval-side bilinear apex.

**Numerical trace:**

```
N=4:   α(0) = 3/8 = 0.375  →  α(∞) = 3/10 ≈ 0.300       (Δ to 1/4 = 1/20)
N=10:  α(0) = 3/8 = 0.375  →  α(∞) = 3/11 ≈ 0.273       (Δ to 1/4 = 1/44)
N=20:  α(0) = 3/8 = 0.375  →  α(∞) = 11/42 ≈ 0.262      (Δ to 1/4 = 1/84)
N→∞:   α(0) = 3/8          →  α(∞) → 1/4                [QuarterAsBilinearMaxval]
```

**Why the asymptote is 1/4 and not 3/8:** the kernel projection averages the static F86b anchor against the rank weighting of the two adjacent popcount sectors. For mid-popcount `P_{N/2}` the Π²-odd content vanishes (Krawtchouk parity); for `P_{N/2−1}` it is exactly half-rank (F98a). The mix weights `1/C(N, m) : 1/C(N, m+1)` approach unity at large N (sectors become equally weighted under uniform amplitude), and the Π²-odd fraction is driven purely by half-rank inheritance from `P_{N/2−1}`, landing at `1/4` because the half-rank halving compounds with the kernel-balance halving to give `(1/2)² = 1/4`.

**Discovery path:** the water-chain inheritance test ([`simulations/water/proton_chain_dicke_anchor.py`](../simulations/water/proton_chain_dicke_anchor.py)) for the morning's F86b anchor uncovered F98 by asking a NEW question: not "what is α at t = 0" (closed-form F86b) but "what is α at t = ∞ under truly-class Heisenberg + Z-dephasing on the chemistry-substrate-grounded proton chain". The water script saw `α → 3/10` for N = 4 at t = 100; the small-fraction structure suggested an algebraic closed form, verified bit-exact N = 4..16, then derived via Krawtchouk + Pascal.

### F99. Five canonical trigonometric anchors via F86b non-uniform Dicke (Tier 1 derived, bit-exact N=4,6,8 across 5 angles; 2026-05-17 night)

**The F86b α-formula α = (1 − γ²)/2 = sin²(θ)/2 evaluated at the canonical trigonometric angles {0°, 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°} produces all five Pi2 dyadic anchors {0, 1/8, 1/4, 3/8, 1/2}. The standard 30°-60°-90° and 45°-45°-90° trigonometry triangles ARE the F86b polarity-anchor triangles.**

The F86b derivation (today morning, commit `b9ba5f6`) parameterised the X⊗N-eigenbasis decomposition of the Dicke superposition `(|D_n⟩ + |D_{n+1}⟩)/√2` (uniform Dicke) and produced three anchors `{0, 3/8, 1/2}` at `γ ∈ {1, 1/2, 0}`. Tonight's extension to NON-UNIFORM Dicke

```
    ψ = (|D_n⟩ + c·|D_{n+1}⟩) / √(1 + c²)   on N even at n = N/2 − 1
    γ = ⟨ψ | X⊗N | ψ⟩ = c² / (1 + c²)        ⟺  c² = γ / (1 − γ)
```

with γ = cos(θ) and the half-angle identity `1 − cos(θ) = 2 sin²(θ/2)` gives

```
    c² = cos(θ) / (2 sin²(θ/2))
    α(θ) = sin²(θ) / 2
```

Five canonical trig angles → five Pi2 dyadic anchors:

| θ | γ = cos(θ) | c² | α = sin²(θ)/2 | Pi2 dyadic anchor |
|---|------------|-----|---------------|-------------------|
| 0° | 1 | ∞ | 0 | Mirror endpoint |
| **30°** | **√3/2** | **2√3 + 3 ≈ 6.464** | **1/8** | **DEPTH-3 (new tonight)** |
| 45° | √2/2 | 1 + √2 (silver ratio) | 1/4 | [QuarterAsBilinearMaxval](#f88b) |
| 60° | 1/2 | 1 (uniform Dicke) | 3/8 | KIntermediate (today morning F86b) |
| 90° | 0 | 0 | 1/2 | Generic / HalfAsStructuralFixedPoint |

**Bit-exact verification** (`simulations/carbon/depth_3_anchor_derivation.py`):
all five anchors verified at N = 4, 6, 8 with Δα < 1e-13 (machine precision).
The 60° case reduces to the morning's clean uniform Dicke c = 1; the 30°, 45°,
90° cases use non-uniform Dicke weights c² = 2√3 + 3, 1 + √2, 0 respectively.

**Why standard trigonometry triangles**: the five canonical angles {0°, 30°,
45°, 60°, 90°} are the only elementary-geometry angles whose sines and cosines
are constructible by ruler and compass (rational or quadratic-irrational
coordinates). The Pi2 dyadic ladder {1/2, 1/4, 1/8, ...} consists of negative
integer powers of 2. F99 establishes that the framework's polarity-squared
algebra IS the F86b α-formula evaluated at the standard-triangle canonical
angles, and the dyadic depth corresponds to the canonical-angle index.

**Periodic-table bridge (tonight, all 9 fractions n/8 derived):**

| α anchor | Trig angle | Period 2 (anchor + complement) | Period 3 (anchor + complement) |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| 0 (= 8/8) | endpoint | He (full noble) | Ne, Ar |
| 1/8 | 30° | Li (1/8), F (7/8 = 1 − 1/8) | Na (1/8), Cl (7/8) |
| 1/4 | 45° | Be (2/8) | Mg |
| 3/8 | 60° | B (3/8 Π²-odd), N (5/8 Π²-even) | Al, P |
| 1/2 | 90° | H (1/2), C (4/8) | Si |

Every period-2/3 element's valence ratio is now F86b-derived from one α(θ)
formula. The Π²-parity complements (1/8 ↔ 7/8, 3/8 ↔ 5/8) cover both the
Π²-odd anchor and its Π²-even companion (β = 1 − α), giving 9 fractions n/8
for n = 0..8.

**Discovery path (today, single session):**

1. Morning (commit `b9ba5f6`): F86b 3/8 anchor derived (uniform Dicke, X⊗N-
   eigenbasis decomposition).
2. Evening ([F98](#f98), commit `250164d`): water-chain inheritance test of
   F86b discovered long-time bridge (N+2)/[4(N+1)] → 1/4.
3. Night #1 (commit `1416f85`): all four polarity anchors realised by
   period 2/3 atoms, forward inheritance.
4. Night #2 (commit `cecb84b`): reverse-spear identified depth-3 (1/8, 7/8)
   as framework gap, empirically instantiated by alkali metals + halogens.
5. Night #3 (commit `5fb0ba0`): depth-3 anchor derived (this F99 entry).
   The bidirectional bridge between framework algebra and periodic-table
   valence structure is now MATERIAL across all 9 fractions.

**Tier outcome: Tier 1 derived.** Closed-form algebraic identity from F86b
α = (1 − γ²)/2 evaluated at five canonical trig angles. Verified bit-exact

### F100. F71 c₁/Q_peak bond-mirror deviation is exactly odd in the F71-anti-palindromic J (observable-side twin of F92) (Tier 1 derived, algebraic + numerically verified N=3,4,5; 2026-05-20)

**For an N-qubit XY chain with uniform Z-dephasing and bond-coupling profile J = (J_0, ..., J_{N−2}), the F71 bond-mirror deviation of the closure-breaking coefficient c₁ (and of the F86c per-bond Q_peak observable),**

    D(b) := c₁(b) − c₁(N−2−b)

**is an exactly odd function of the F71-anti-palindromic component of J.** Write the mirrored profile F71(J)_b := J_{N−2−b} and split J = J_sym + J_anti with J_sym = (J + F71(J))/2 (F71-palindromic) and J_anti = (J − F71(J))/2 (F71-anti-palindromic). Then in (J_sym, J_anti) coordinates D(b; J_sym, −J_anti) = −D(b; J_sym, J_anti), to all orders.

**Palindromic survival:** J_anti = 0 ⟹ D = −D ⟹ D = 0. The F71 c₁/Q_peak bond-mirror holds for every palindromic J, however non-uniform J_sym is. F71 never required uniform J; it requires palindromic J. Uniform is merely the simplest palindromic profile.

**Graceful breakdown:** the Taylor series of D in J_anti has odd powers only, so D is leading-order linear in the asymmetry B_b = J_b − J_{N−2−b} = 2(J_anti)_b. Graceful, not a hard violation. The leading coefficient κ_b is the c₁-gradient at J_sym and generically depends on J_sym (Tier 2 empirical); the parity argument fixes the oddness, not the coefficient.

**Derivation (Tier 1):** R-equivariance of the PROOF_C1 apparatus for a non-uniform base profile gives Step 1, c₁(b; J) = c₁(N−2−b; F71(J)), since R_sup·L(J)·R_sup = L(F71(J)) relabels bond b to bond N−2−b. Step 2: D(b; J) = c₁(b; J) − c₁(b; F71(J)), so D(b; F71(J)) = −D(b; J), which with F71(J) = J_sym − J_anti is the oddness. The identical R-conjugation argument applies to F86c's per-bond observable K_b(Q, t), built R-equivariantly: ΔQ_peak(b) is odd in J_anti, zero for palindromic J.

**Connection to F92:** observable-side twin of F92. F92 (spectrum side) = the F71-refined diagonal-block eigenvalue multiset depends only on J_sym (J_anti invisible to the diagonal-block spectrum). F100 (observable side) = the c₁/Q_peak bond-mirror deviation vanishes for palindromic J and is exactly odd in J_anti (its magnitude also carries J_sym, per the line above). Two faces of one J_sym/J_anti split.

**Verified:** N = 3, 4, 5 via the full 4^N Liouvillian, no truncation; probe states ψ_1+vac and ψ_2+vac, base profile swept over s ∈ {0, ±0.04, ±0.08, ±0.12} along a linear-ramp J_anti direction, 4 palindromic J_sym profiles. Palindromic-survival max\|D(s=0)\| ≤ 4.0e−10; oddness residual max\|D(+s)+D(−s)\| ≤ 1.0e−9; even-power (constant, quadratic) fit coefficients ≤ ~3e−8. The leading coefficient κ shows 76% / 62% / 143% relative spread across the 4 J_sym profiles at N=3 / 4 / 5, confirming the J_sym-dependence.

### F101. F71 c₁ bond-mirror deviation is exactly odd in the F71-anti-palindromic γ (observable-side twin of F91) (Tier 1 derived, algebraic + numerically verified N=3,4,5; 2026-05-21)

**For an N-qubit XY chain with uniform coupling J and a per-site Z-dephasing profile γ = (γ_0, ..., γ_{N−1}), the F71 bond-mirror deviation of the closure-breaking coefficient c₁,**

    D(b) := c₁(b) − c₁(N−2−b)

**is an exactly odd function of the F71-anti-palindromic component of γ.** Write the mirrored profile F71(γ)_l := γ_{N−1−l} (site-mirror l ↔ N−1−l) and split γ = γ_sym + γ_anti with γ_sym = (γ + F71(γ))/2 (F71-palindromic) and γ_anti = (γ − F71(γ))/2 (F71-anti-palindromic). Then D(b; γ_sym, −γ_anti) = −D(b; γ_sym, γ_anti), to all orders.

**Palindromic survival:** γ_anti = 0 ⟹ D = −D ⟹ D = 0. The F71 c₁ bond-mirror holds for every palindromic γ, however non-uniform γ_sym is. F71 never required uniform γ; it requires palindromic (R-symmetric) γ. The symmetric component of γ still pairs bonds.

**Graceful breakdown:** the Taylor series of D in γ_anti has odd powers only, so D is leading-order linear in the per-site asymmetry. Graceful, not a hard violation. The leading coefficient κ_γ is the c₁-gradient at γ_sym and generically depends on γ_sym (Tier 2 empirical); the parity argument fixes the oddness, not the coefficient. κ_γ has no closed form (∂c₁/∂γ, c₁ itself a non-closed numerical fit).

**Derivation (Tier 1):** R-equivariance of the PROOF_C1 apparatus gives Step 1, c₁(b; γ) = c₁(N−2−b; F71(γ)), since the dephasing dissipator D[ρ] = Σ_l γ_l (Z_l ρ Z_l − ρ) is linear in each γ_l and R_sup·L(γ)·R_sup = L(F71(γ)) relabels site l ↔ N−1−l. Step 2: D(b; γ) = c₁(b; γ) − c₁(b; F71(γ)), so D(b; F71(γ)) = −D(b; γ), which with F71(γ) = γ_sym − γ_anti is the oddness.

**Connection to F91:** observable-side twin of F91. F91 (spectrum side) = the F71-refined diagonal-block eigenvalue multiset depends only on γ_sym (the pair-sums S_l = γ_l + γ_{N−1−l} = 2·γ_sym[l]; γ_anti invisible to the spectrum). F101 (observable side) = the c₁ bond-mirror deviation vanishes for palindromic γ and is exactly odd in γ_anti; its parity and zero set are fixed by γ_anti alone, while its magnitude κ_γ also depends on γ_sym (above). Two faces of one γ_sym/γ_anti split. The J-side observable twin is F100.

**Scope:** c₁ only. The F86c per-bond Q_peak observable is not covered: its Q-axis Q = J/γ₀ and EP time t_peak = 1/(4γ₀) are defined against a scalar γ₀, which a non-uniform per-site γ does not provide. The γ_avg-anchored Q_peak route and the h-detuning observable twin follow by the same parameter-agnostic argument and are noted in PROOF_F101 as separable extensions.

**Verified:** N = 3, 4, 5 via the exact (N+1)²-dim popcount-sector restriction (bit-identical to the full 4^N Liouvillian, Gate-1 self-test, maximum difference 0); probe states ψ_1+vac and ψ_2+vac, base profile swept over s ∈ {0, ±0.01, ±0.02, ±0.03} along a linear-ramp γ_anti direction, 4 palindromic γ_sym profiles, J held uniform. Palindromic-survival max\|D(s=0)\| ≤ 1.3e−9 and oddness residual max\|D(+s)+D(−s)\| ≤ 4.4e−9, against an O(1) deviation signal (typical \|D\| from 0.6 at N=3 to 2.3 at N=5); the oddness residual is the direct machine-zero even-power probe. The leading coefficient κ_γ shows a 76 to 128 percent relative spread across the 4 γ_sym profiles, confirming the γ_sym-dependence (Tier 2 empirical, no closed form).

### F102. Y-Parity Term-Level Z₂ Independence at k_body≥3 (Tier 1 derived, verified)

For any Pauli string σ = ⊗_l σ_α_l on N qubits:

    y_par(σ) = n_Y(σ) mod 2     (term-level Y-parity classifier)
    bit_a(σ) = (n_X + n_Y) mod 2    (F61 Π²_X axis)
    bit_b(σ) = (n_Y + n_Z) mod 2    (F63 Π²_Z axis)

At k_body=2 (the 9 Pauli bilinears XX, XY, XZ, YX, YY, YZ, ZX, ZY, ZZ),
the identity y_par = bit_a XOR bit_b holds. More generally the identity
holds iff k_body is even.

At k_body=3 (and odd k_body in general), y_par and (bit_a XOR bit_b)
differ by 1: y_par = (k_body + (bit_a XOR bit_b)) mod 2. So Y-parity
is independent of the Klein (bit_a, bit_b) signature once k_body
ranges over both even and odd values.

**Canonical k_body=3 demonstration:** XYZ has (bit_a, bit_b, y_par) = (0, 0, 1);
II...I has (0, 0, 0). Both share Klein (0, 0) but differ on y_par,
exhibiting the Z₂³ structure of the cubic polarity layer.

**Operator vs term level:** per F34/QUBIT_NECESSITY there is no third
independent Π²-operator (Π²_Y collapses to Π²_Z at the operator level).
F102 is a term-level classifier statement, not an operator-level
Pi²-Inheritance.

### F103. F87 Trichotomy Z₂³ Refinement at k_body=3 (Tier 1 derived, N=4 anchor)

After F102 established that Y-parity y_par = n_Y mod 2 is independent of the
Klein (bit_a, bit_b) signature at k_body≥3, F103 captures how Y-parity actually
refines the existing F87 trichotomy (truly / soft / hard) at k_body=3 with
empirical anchor at N=4.

**Empirical setup:** 294 Z₂³-homogeneous + Y-par-homogeneous k_body=3 Pauli
pairs at N=4, each classified under Z, X, Y single-letter dephasing via
`classify_pauli_pair`, bucketed by (Klein × dephase letter × y_par ×
trichotomy class).

**Five structural sub-statements:**

1. *Truly is y_par=0-pure.* Across all 12 (Klein × dephase) cells, every truly
   classification has y_par=0; total truly across the grid = 300, y_par=1
   truly count = 0.

2. *Hard in diagonal cells (Klein matches dephase letter) splits 42:8 with
   Y-inversion.* Z-deph in Klein (0,1) hard = (42, 8); X-deph in (1,0) hard =
   (42, 8); Y-deph in (1,1) hard = (8, 42). The Y-deph swap reflects that Y
   carries y_par=1.

3. *Same diagonal cells contain a soft 13:13 y_par-symmetric split.* Sum 26
   per cell; unlike hard's 42:8 asymmetry, soft is y_par-symmetric in these
   cells.

4. *Mother sector (0,0) soft is y_par=1-pure.* All 3 letter cells in Klein
   (0,0) soft equal (0, 21).

5. *Off-diagonal soft (6 cells: Klein non-mother and Klein ≠ dephase Klein)
   splits into Pattern B + Pattern C.* Pattern B (3 cells, proportional to
   (Klein, y_par) enumeration breakdown): (0,1) Y-deph = (55, 21); (1,1)
   Z-deph = (21, 55); (1,1) X-deph = (21, 55). Pattern C (3 cells, y_par=1-pure):
   (0,1) X-deph = (0, 21); (1,0) Z-deph = (0, 21); (1,0) Y-deph = (0, 21).

**Status (2026-06-05, closed 2026-06-10):** the 42:8 split is derived by a closed-form counting rule
(PROOF §6); the bipartite-chirality mechanism (§7) derives the soft direction, N-stability
is verified at N=5 (F105), and F106 is the k=4 sibling. The windowed (k<N) hard-direction
converse non-bipartite ⟹ hard is now a **theorem with no residual** (the Phase B two-reflection
theorem [the F87 windowed-converse proof](proofs/PROOF_F87_WINDOWED_MONOMIAL_CONVERSE.md),
2026-06-09, closed 2026-06-10): the threshold #A ≥ 2ℓ, the bipartite ⟹ soft re-proof, the monomial
expansion structure, and the deg-1 class in closed form (the girth ladder: the supertrace factorization
through t_j = Tr(Z_l H^j) and P_{2ℓ+1,1} = (2ℓ+1)·C(2ℓ,ℓ)·Σ_l t_ℓ², whose ℓ=1 face is
P_{3,1} = 6·4^N·Σ_l c_l²) are Tier1Derived (`WindowedConverseThresholdClaim`), and the Pascal-Gram
positivity theorem (= **F117**) makes every coefficient of the first nonvanishing odd power-sum a sum
of squares or exactly zero, so "all but finitely many γ" upgrades to **all γ > 0** unconditionally
(R-deg retired by the girth dichotomy, R-sign resolved by Pascal-Gram positivity, both 2026-06-10). The
closure is typed as WindowedConverseAllGammaClaim (Tier1Derived, no residual). Separately, the
combinatorics are closed-form (the valuation criterion, the obstruction-size law min(2W−1, 2k−3), and
the A203241 hard count, §7.7–§7.8 = **F115**). **Open:** the (pair Klein, dephase letter) →
(Pattern B vs Pattern C) selection rule; hardware confirmation of k≥3 F87 (all 5 Marrakesh F87
confirmations are k=2).

### F104. C# k≥3 trichotomy classifier lift (verification mechanism, not a typed Claim)

F104 lifts the F87 trichotomy classifier to k≥3-body Hamiltonians in C#. The overload
`PauliPairTrichotomy.Classify(IReadOnlyList<PauliTerm>, ChainSystem, PauliLetter dephaseLetter)`
builds the sliding-window k-body chain Hamiltonian (via `PauliKBodyChainExtensions.ChainKBody`)
from a Pauli-term list and returns its truly / soft / hard class.

F104 is a **mechanism, not a typed Claim**: it closes F103's out-of-scope "C# k≥3 classifier
lift" by re-classifying the 294 N=4 k=3 Z₂³-homogeneous pairs in C# and verifying bit-exact
agreement with F103's frozen Python counts (from `classify_pauli_pair`). It is the C# engine
that the F105 (N=5 k=3) and F106 (N=4 k=4) anchors call at larger N / k.

**Verified:** 294 N=4 k=3 pairs, C# vs Python frozen counts, bit-exact match.

### F105. F87 Trichotomy Z₂³ Refinement at k_body=3 N=5 (Tier 1 derived, N-stability test of F103)

F105 anchors the F87 Z₂³ refinement at N=5 k=3 using the same 294 Z₂³-homogeneous
Pauli pair enumeration as F103, classified via F104's C# k-body classifier.

F85 (k-body generalization) predicts the Π²-class trichotomy is N-stable for any
k. F105 tests whether this lifts to the y_par sub-refinement.

**Observed outcome:** F85's N-stability prediction is CONFIRMED at the y_par axis:
F105's 5 sub-statement counts at N=5 k=3 are bit-exactly identical to F103's at
N=4 k=3 (truly 300 / 0 y_par=1; hard diagonal (42, 8) / (42, 8) / (8, 42);
diagonal soft (13, 13) ×3; mother soft (0, 21) ×3; off-diagonal Pattern B +
Pattern C cells unchanged). The cubic Z₂³ architecture is N-invariant in its
sub-cell structure at k=3.

**Method:** 882 classifications via the SLOW_F105_BATCH tool; ~3h dense batch,
accelerated to ~12 min via PLINQ in the Task 7 run.

### F106. F87 Trichotomy Z₂³ Refinement at k=4 N=4 (Tier 1 derived, k-stability test of F103)

After F105 confirmed F85's N-stability lift to the y_par sub-refinement at k=3
(N=4 to N=5 counts identical), F106 anchors at k=4 N=4 to test the orthogonal
axis: k-stability. F85 does not predict k-stability of the y_par sub-refinement;
the Klein (0,0) enum balance shifts from 45/21 at k=3 to 780/300 at k=4, and the
structural worry was that "mother soft is y_par=1-pure" would break.

**Method:** 12744 classifications (4248 pairs × 3 dephase letters) at N=4 via
F104's `PauliPairTrichotomy.Classify(IReadOnlyList<PauliTerm>, ...)`. SLOW_F106_BATCH
tool (~2-3min PLINQ on 24 cores; actual run 3m 59s).

**Observed outcome (mixed k-stability at k=4):**

- TrulyCounts: 3924 total, y_par=1 count 0. Y_par=0-purity HELD bit-structurally.
- HardDiagonalSplit: (228, 0) / (228, 0) / (0, 228). 42:8 ratio at k=3 BROKE
  (sharpened to fully pure 228:0 / 0:228); Y-inversion structure HELD qualitatively.
- DiagonalSoftSplit: (300, 528) / (300, 528) / (528, 300). 13:13 y_par-symmetry
  at k=3 BROKE (asymmetric 300:528 with Y-inversion).
- MotherSoftCounts: (0, 300) / (0, 300) / (0, 300). Y_par=1-purity HELD
  bit-structurally despite the (0,0) enum-balance shift; only the counts
  re-scaled from k=3's (0, 21) to k=4's (0, 300).
- OffDiagonalSoftPatterns: 6 cells. 3 cells preserve Pattern C analog (0, 528);
  3 cells (which at k=3 were asymmetric Pattern B (55, 21)/(21, 55)) became
  fully y_par-symmetric (528, 528) at k=4.

The two purity statements (truly y_par=0-pure, mother soft y_par=1-pure) are
genuine y_par-axis invariants that survive across k; the mixed-ratio statements
(42:8 hard, 13:13 soft, Pattern B asymmetry) were k-specific and re-shape with
the enum balance.

### F107. F87 Truly Classification Forces y_par = 0 (Tier 1 derived, closed-form corollary of F85)

After F103/F105/F106 anchored 4524 truly classifications empirically (all with
y_par = 0, zero with y_par = 1), F107 derives this in closed form as a direct
corollary of F85's k-body truly criterion, extended from F85's Z-dephasing
proof to all three dephase letters (X, Y, Z) via the per-dephase Π² eigenvalue
rule (`PiOperator.SquaredEigenvalue`) combined with dissipator commutativity
(F84 Pauli-Channel Cancellation Lemma). F107 is the first DERIVED-not-EMPIRICAL
Claim in the F87 Z₂³ refinement family.

**Per-dephase truly criteria** (each combining Π²-even with dissipator-commute):

- Z-dephase: #Y even AND #Z even
- X-dephase: #X even AND #Y even
- Y-dephase: #Y even AND #Z even

All three include `#Y even` as a sub-condition. Since `y_par = #Y mod 2`,
every truly term has y_par = 0; every truly y_par-homogeneous pair has shared
y_par = 0. Bit-exact verification across all 64 k=3 + 256 k=4 letter
sequences × 3 dephase letters (`TrulyYParityZeroPurityTests.VerifyOnTerm_*`).

**Sibling y_par-axis claims** (all closed 2026-05-25): F108 Part 1+2+3
(Π²-even palindrome family, Tier1Derived); F109 (MotherSoftYParityOnePurity,
Tier1Derived unconditional); F110 (HardCellYInversionPattern, Tier1Derived since 2026-06-10).
Together F107+F109+F110 pin the y_par signature of all three F87 trichotomy
classes.

### F108 Part 1. Π²-Even Hamiltonians Always Admit an Exact Palindrome Operator (Tier 1 derived, Π_5bilinear phase variant of canonical P1 Π)

Every Hamiltonian H built from the five Π²_Z-even 2-site bilinears {XX, YY, YZ,
ZY, ZZ} with arbitrary real bond coefficients, plus Z-dephasing on every site,
admits an EXACT operator-level palindrome:

  Π_5bilinear · L · Π_5bilinear⁻¹ = −L − 2σ · I exactly, σ = Σ_l γ_l.

Hence spec(L) is palindromic around −σ, and no Π²-even Pauli pair (truly or
non-truly) can be F87-hard. Closes the empirical observation that 5346+ Π²-even
pairs across F103/F105/F106 anchors were observed soft with zero hard.

**The Π_5bilinear per-site map:** I → +1·X, X → −1·I, Y → +i·Z, Z → −i·Y. Same
I↔X, Y↔Z permutation as the canonical Heisenberg Π (P1 family from
[Palindromic Symmetry Beyond Heisenberg](../experiments/NON_HEISENBERG_PALINDROME.md)) with
two phase flips: the X→I and Z→Y arrows carry sign −1 and −i. Per-site
properties: M² = diag(−1, −1, +1, +1) on {I, X, Y, Z}; M⁴ = I; M is order-4 and
unitary on the 4-dim per-site Pauli basis. Π_5bilinear is a Liouville-space
automorphism, NOT a Hilbert-space conjugation (no 2×2 U satisfies U·I·U† = X
since U·I·U† = I).

**Mechanism:**

1. M⊗N anti-commutes with the commutator superoperator [B, ·] for every
   Π²_Z-even 2-body bilinear B ∈ {XX, YY, YZ, ZY, ZZ} (verified bit-exact at
   the 2-qubit level; the 4 Π²-odd bilinears {XY, XZ, YX, ZX} produce residual
   = 8.00, clean separation).
2. Per-site dissipator: M · D[Z_l] · M⁻¹ = −D[Z_l] − 2γ_l · I via diagonal
   permutation in the Pauli basis. D[Z]_pauli = γ · diag(0, −2, −2, 0) on
   {I, X, Y, Z}; M's (I↔X, Y↔Z) swap permutes the diagonal entries to
   γ · diag(−2, 0, 0, −2) = −D[Z]_pauli − 2γ · I_4 (phase factors cancel
   pairwise on each 2-cycle).
3. Combining 1 + 2: Π_5bilinear · L · Π_5bilinear⁻¹ = −L − 2σ · I exactly.

**Resolution of the previously open ker(M) attempt:** Earlier exploration tried
to close F108 Part 1 by proving every L-eigenvector lies in ker(M) (M = F1
residual for canonical Π). Numerical verification falsified that lemma: only
2/64 L-eigenvectors at the N=3 YZ+ZY test case satisfied M·v_λ = 0. The
follow-up Critical Isospectral Lemma reduction was circular (it restated the
spectral palindrome under another name). The actual mechanism is structurally
different: a DIFFERENT per-site Π operator (Π_5bilinear) gives EXACT residual
zero without going through M at all.

**Empirical confirmation:** bit-exact residual = 0 across 9 pure-Π²-even
non-truly pairs (YZ, ZY, XX+YZ, XX+ZY, YY+YZ, YY+ZY, YZ+ZY, YZ+ZZ, ZY+ZZ) at
N=3, 4, 5; 15 random non-uniform-J instances + 9 asymmetric J_YZ ≠ J_ZY
instances; pure D[Z]^⊗N dissipator. Reproduction:
`simulations/f108_part1_pi_family_scan.py` plus
`simulations/f108_part1_proof_algebra.py` for the 2-qubit anti-commutation
verification.

**Siblings:**

- **F108 Part 2 (BitA twin, X-dephasing, Tier 1 derived 2026-05-25):** the
  X-dephasing analog via the I↔Z, X↔Y phase-variant of Π_5bilinear. Same
  proof structure as Part 1, restricted to the Π²_X-even bilinear set
  {ZZ, XX, XY, YX, YY}. Per-site map: I → +Z, Z → −I, X → −iY, Y → +iX;
  per-site M² = diag(−1, +1, +1, −1) on {I, X, Y, Z}. Closes the X-dephasing
  branch of F109 Step 5. F108 Part 1's BitATwin slot points at this Claim
  (status `Filled`).
- **F108 Part 3 (Y-dephasing sibling, Tier 1 derived 2026-05-25):** the
  Y-dephasing analog. Same I↔X, Y↔Z permutation as Part 1 (Y-deph and Z-deph
  share bit_b parity per `PiOperator.SquaredEigenvalue`); per-site map
  I → +X, X → −I, Y → −iZ, Z → +iY differs from Part 1's only in the Y/Z
  2-cycle phase (−i vs +i, matching Y-deph's canonical Π convention). Same
  Π²-even bilinear set {XX, YY, YZ, ZY, ZZ} as Part 1; same M² sign pattern
  diag(−1, −1, +1, +1). Closes the Y-dephasing branch of F109 Step 5,
  promoting F109 to fully unconditional Tier1Derived across {Z, X, Y}.
  Part 3 is BitB axis (shares bit_b with Part 1); BitATwin slot is
  `BitBSpecific` (Y-deph has no meaningful bit_a analog).
- **F108 Klein-V₄ equivalence (Welle 14, 2026-05-27):** Parts 2 and 3 are
  Klein-V₄ corollaries of Part 1 via two complementary mechanisms.
  Part 1 ↔ Part 3 via operator-space D-conjugation (D · Π_5b(Z) · D = Π_5b(Y)
  bit-exact at N = 1, 2, 3; bilinear set fixed on bit_b axis). Part 1 ↔ Part 2
  via Hilbert-space Hadamard transport (U_op = U_H^⊗N ⊗ (U_H^⊗N)^* maps
  L_Z → L_X bit-exact; per-letter Hadamard bijects Part-1 bilinear set onto
  Part-2 bilinear set). NEGATIVE on operator-space Klein-V₄ for Π_5b:
  Q_zx · Π_5b(Z) · Q_zx ≠ ±Π_5b(X) and H · Π_5b(Y) · H ≠ ±Π_5b(X) (residual
  2.0 in Frobenius distance at N = 1, 2, 3); the operator-space Klein-V₄
  action on Π_5b is only the {I, D} subgroup; X-deph enters via Hilbert-space
  Hadamard. The three typed Claims are KEPT SEPARATE to preserve independent
  integration edges but cross-reference the equivalence proof.

  with bit_b-homogeneous dissipator c. F108 and F112 are two independent

### F109. Mother Sector Soft is y_par = 1 Pure (Tier 1 derived, fully unconditional after F108 Part 1+2+3 closure 2026-05-25)

Sister to F107 on the y_par axis. F107 pinned the y_par signature of truly cells
across all dephase letters; F109 pins the y_par signature of mother sector
(Klein (0, 0)) soft cells. Previously Tier 1 derived modulo F108 Part 1; on
2026-05-25 all three branches of Step 5 (Z-dephasing via F108 Part 1, X-dephasing
via F108 Part 2, Y-dephasing via F108 Part 3) were closed-form via the matching
Π_5bilinear dephase variants. F109 is now fully unconditional Tier 1 derived.

**Theorem (F109):** Under any single-letter dephase channel (Z, X, or Y), every
Pauli pair classified as soft and located in the Mother sector Klein (0, 0) has
shared y_par = 1.

**Derivation chain:**

1. Klein (0, 0) constraint (bit_a = 0 AND bit_b = 0) forces all three letter
   counts #X, #Y, #Z to share the same parity (all even or all odd).
2. Per F107 per-dephase truly criteria, combined with Step 1's same-parity:
   Klein (0, 0) truly = all three counts even (y_par = 0).
3. Klein (0, 0) non-truly = all three counts odd (y_par = 1).
4. Klein (0, 0) is Π²-EVEN under every dephase letter (bit_b = 0 for Z/Y;
   bit_a = 0 for X).
5. Π²-even non-truly pairs are soft (not hard): closed-form across all three
   dephase letters via the F108 Part 1+2+3 family. Z-dephasing per F108 Part 1
   via Π_5bilinear; X-dephasing per F108 Part 2 via the X-deph variant (typed
   as F108 Part 1's BitATwin slot, `Filled`); Y-dephasing per F108 Part 3 via
   the Y-deph variant (BitB-axis sibling of Part 1 on the same Π²_Z axis;
   `BitBSpecific` BitATwin slot). All three parts closed 2026-05-25.
6. Klein (0, 0) soft term ⟹ y_par = 1; y_par-homogeneous pair: shared y_par = 1.

**Empirical confirmation:** F103 mother soft (0, 21) × 3 dephase; F105 same;
F106 (0, 300) × 3. Total 1026 mother-soft classifications, all y_par = 1, zero
y_par = 0. F109 explains this bit-exactly across all three dephase letters via
the F108 Part 1+2+3 closure.

**Cross-letter spot-check:** Klein (0, 0) non-truly k=3 terms are the 6
XYZ-permutations (only triple with all-odd and sum ≤ 3). Unordered pairs with
self: 6·7/2 = 21 (matches F103/F105). At k=4: 24 letter sequences (3 non-I + 1 I),
24·25/2 = 300 (matches F106).

### F110. F87-Hard Cells Exhibit Y-Inversion Pattern (Tier 1 derived, promoted 2026-06-10; Aspect A closed-form via F108 Part 1+2+3 + F107 + F109 + F87 dissipator-resonance, Aspect B+C derived via F103 §6/§7 + the closed windowed converse)

Seventh YParity-axis Claim; completes the y_par-axis classification of the F87
trichotomy together with F107 (truly y_par=0) and F109 (mother soft y_par=1).

**Aspect A (closed-form):** F87-hard pairs appear only in the diagonal Klein cell
matching the dephase letter (Z → (0, 1), X → (1, 0), Y → (1, 1)). Derivation:
F108 Part 1+2+3 close Π²-D-even cells (never hard); F107 + F109 close Mother
sector Klein (0, 0); the F87 dissipator-resonance law (Tier1Derived, anchored at
N=4 k=3 over 294 pairs in `DissipatorResonanceLaw.cs`) selects the one diagonal
cell among the two remaining Π²-D-odd non-mother cells. Combining all three
closures: hard appears only in the diagonal cell.

**Aspect B (Y-inversion):** Within the diagonal hard cell, the dominant y_par
equals y_par(dephase letter): Z/X-deph dominantly y_par=0, Y-deph dominantly
y_par=1. At k = N = 4 the dominance is closed-form Tier1Derived via the
sibling Claim F111 (HardCellPureDTemplate, 2026-05-25): every F87-hard pair in
the diagonal cell contains at least one "pure-D template" (only D and I
letters), and pure-D templates have y_par = y_par(D) by construction. At k = 3
the 42:8 dominance follows from the §6 counting rule (see Aspect C).

**Aspect C (k-purity sharpening, §6 closed-form counting rule):** k=3 N=4 (F103): 42:8 biased; k=3
N=5 (F105): identical 42:8 (N-stable); k=4 N=4 (F106): 228:0 fully pure with
Y-inversion preserved.

**Status (promoted Tier1Derived 2026-06-10):** the 42:8 (k=3) and 228:0 (k=4) ratios are derived by
the §6 counting rule and the §7 bipartite mechanism; F111 closes the k=4 case at full support. The
windowed (k<N) hard-direction converse (non-bipartite ⟹ hard) is a **theorem with no residual**
(`WindowedConverseAllGammaClaim`, Tier1Derived: R-deg retired by the girth dichotomy, R-sign resolved
by the Pascal-Gram positivity theorem F117, both 2026-06-10), which was the F110/F111 promotion gate.

### F111. Hard Cell Pure-D Template Rule (Tier 1 derived, promoted 2026-06-10; closed-form structural rule that implies F110 Aspect B at k = N = 4)

Eighth YParity-axis Claim; sharpens F110 Aspect B by replacing "Y-inversion at
k = 4" with a structural rule that implies it as immediate corollary AND
provides the per-cell decomposition 36 + 192 + 0 = 228 across all 3 dephases.

**Theorem (F111):** At k = N = 4 in the diagonal Klein cell (D.BitA(), D.BitB())
for dephase letter D ∈ {Z, X, Y}, a Pauli pair (P, Q) is F87-hard if and only if
at least one of P, Q is a "pure-D template" (a length-4 Pauli string composed
only of D and I letters, no other non-I Pauli letter).

**Corollary (F110 Aspect B at k = 4):** Pure-D templates have y_par = y_par(D)
by construction. Therefore every F87-hard pair at k = N = 4 in the diagonal cell
has y_par(pair) = y_par(D). This is the F106 228:0 split across all 3 dephases.

**Structural decomposition (per diagonal cell at k = N = 4):** 528 total pairs
split into 36 Pure-Pure (all HARD) + 192 Pure-Mixed (all HARD) + 300 Mixed-Mixed
(all SOFT). The 36 + 192 + 0 = 228 hard count matches F106 exactly.

**Subclaim status:**
- (a) Pure-D single-term H is HARD: heuristic via dissipator-commute ([D[D_l], L_H] = 0
  for pure-D H gives additive independent spectra L = L_H + L_D, combined
  spectrum non-palindromic around −σ). Empirical: 8/8 per cell.
- (b) Mixed single-term H is SOFT: empirical (24/24 per cell).
- (c) Pair (Pure-D, Mixed) H is HARD: empirical (192/192 per cell).
- (d) Pair (Mixed, Mixed) H is SOFT: **CLOSED modulo M via PROOF_F103 §7.4
  (2026-05-30)**. At full support k = N a Mixed+Mixed pair has at most two flip
  generators, which always admit a linear φ and hence the chiral K, so the
  hopping graph is bipartite and the pair soft. Empirical: 300/300 per cell.
  (The earlier operator-level search, Task 1 Paths 1-3 per-site M^N tensor
  product / F108 Π_5bilinear extended action / Q_V × Π composition, was
  dissolved by the chiral route.)

**Empirical anchor:** F106 N = 4 k = 4 records 228:0 in all 3 diagonal cells
(684 hard pairs total, zero off-y_par). Independent verification at
`simulations/f111_pair_off_ypar_verify.py` covers 1584 pair classifications
across 3 dephases, all matching the rule with zero exceptions.

**Promotion record (2026-06-10):** the hard-direction converse behind subclaims (a)/(c)
(non-bipartite ⟹ hard at every γ) closed as the windowed all-γ theorem with no residual
(`WindowedConverseAllGammaClaim`, Tier1Derived: girth dichotomy + Pascal-Gram positivity F117), so
F111 is Tier1Derived; subclaim (d) was already closed modulo M via PROOF_F103 §7.4 (see above).
**Open:** Pure-D Template Rule at k > 4 or N > 4 (empirically unverified). Hardware QPU
confirmation at k ≥ 3.

### F112. Lindblad Π-Eigenvalue Balance under bit_b Homogeneity (Tier 1 derived for both Hermitian and non-Hermitian H, universal N)

Structural identity making the `polarity_coordinates_from_L` diagnostic
asymmetry an exact witness for c outside the bit_b-homogeneous regime. Sits on
the bit_b Z₂-grading of the Pauli group shared with F108 (Π²-Z-even bilinear
palindrome closure) and F87 (dissipator-resonance trichotomy).

**Theorem (F112, Hermitian H, rigorous):** For any Lindblad-form Liouvillian
L = -i[H, ·] + Σ_k γ_k · `np.kron(c_k, c_k^*)` on N qubits with Hermitian H
and each c_k bit_b-homogeneous (every Pauli string σ in c_k's expansion
shares bit_b(σ) = (#Y(σ) + #Z(σ)) mod 2 = const), the
`polarity_coordinates_from_L` decomposition of M = Π L Π⁻¹ + L + 2σ·I
satisfies

    ‖M_plus_half‖² = ‖M_minus_half‖²

bit-exactly (machine precision), for any choice of complex coefficients γ_k
and any Pauli-coefficient choice in each c_k.

**Non-Hermitian extension (Tier 1 derived, universal N, Welle 11, 2026-05-27):**
the equality also holds for non-Hermitian H. Writing H = H_re + i H_im with both
summands Hermitian, the equality reduces algebraically to the open identity
Im⟨L_{H_re,-i}, L_{H_im,-i}⟩ = 0 for any Hermitian H_re, H_im. This identity is
now closed structurally for all N via the Welle 11 two-lemma proof
(Diagonal-Norm + Off-Diagonal-Orthogonality) in
`docs/proofs/PROOF_F112_NONHERMITIAN_UNIVERSAL_N.md`, making the non-Hermitian
extension Tier1Derived universal N. The 559,912-pair basis enumeration at
N ≤ 5 (Welle 10a Python + Welle 10b C# SLOW_F112) is preserved as the
empirical anchor that motivated the search for the structural proof; it
remains the historical numerical validation.

**Five-step structure:**
- Step 1: reduce balance to Π-conjugation ±i Frobenius equality:
  asymmetry = (1/2) (‖M_{+i}‖² − ‖M_{-i}‖²).
- Step 2: bit_b-homogeneous c implies `np.kron(c, c.conj())` lies entirely in
  the Π²-conjugation +1 eigenspace (via F38 / F63 Π² eigenvalue formula on
  Pauli strings).
- Step 3: Π²-conj +1 eigenspace = Π-conj {+1, −1}; dissipator has zero +i,
  −i content.
- Step 4: M_{+i} and M_{-i} come entirely from L_H, with norms
  2 · ‖L_{H,±i}‖².
- Step 5 (Hermitian H): L_H^† = −L_H (anti-Hermitian as superoperator) plus
  dagger maps Π +i ↔ Π −i bijectively while preserving Frobenius. Combining
  gives ‖L_{H,+i}‖² = ‖L_{H,-i}‖².

**Connection axes (shared bit_b Z₂-grading on the Pauli group):**
- F38: Π² = (−1)^{w_YZ} on Pauli strings; foundational input.
- F63: [L, Π²] = 0 for Z-dephasing; foundational input.
- F108 Part 1/2/3: the bilinear set {XX, YY, YZ, ZY, ZZ} F108 palindromizes
  is exactly the bit_b = 0 (Π²-Z-even) family.
- F87 dissipator-resonance trichotomy: orthogonal axis, derived 2026-06-10
  (previously empirical via `polarity_probe_f87_connection.py`). F87 lives
  in M's spectrum-palindrome structure; F112 lives in M_anti's Π +i/−i
  split. Three-part derivation: (a) scope inclusion (every F87 input,
  Hermitian Pauli H + pure Z-deph with single-Pauli c = Z_l, satisfies
  F112's hypotheses, so the asymmetry is identically zero on F87's entire
  domain, all three classes; asym = 0.0 exact float zero at N = 3, 4);
  (b) mechanism separation (on bit_b-odd H, the diagonal Klein cell, the
  dagger involution IS the windowed converse's first reflection,
  M_rec† = 𝓕 M_rec 𝓕 with 𝓕 = X^⊗N ⊗ X^⊗N, diff 0.00e+00; F112 reads it
  at degree 2 via Frobenius norms of Π-eigenprojections, F87 hardness at
  odd degree via the second reflection R + unsigned girth); (c) scoped
  one-way F113 bridge on the σ⁻/σ⁺ family: both functionals read the shared
  moment t₁^(l) = Tr(Z_l H) = 2^N c_l = 2^(N−1) ω_l, F113 linearly
  (asym = 2^N · Σ_l t₁^(l) · (γ_pump,l − γ_T1,l); machine-precision match
  |diff| = 7.1e-15 at N=3 after the ω_l = 2c_l + σ⁻-lowering convention
  reconciliation), the girth ladder's ℓ=1 face quadratically
  (p₃ = 6γ · Σ_l (t₁^(l))²), so balance-broken ⟹ F87-hard, one-way only.

### F113. F112 Counterexample Asymmetry Closed Form (Tier 1 derived for general N via Welle 4)

Closed-form magnitude for the F112 polarity asymmetry in the regime where
F112's typed scope is violated by single-site Z-drive × amplitude-damping
interference. Discovered via Welle 2 Kingston hardware analysis (commit
`a1a90a2`, 2026-05-26), derived constructively the same day via parameter-
sweep regression (commit referencing this entry).

**Theorem (F113):** For Lindblad-form L = -i[H, ·] + Σ_k γ_k · D[c_k] with:
- Hermitian H containing single-site Z-drives Σ_l (ω_l/2)·Z_l plus any
  bit_b-homogeneous additions (X-drive, Y-drive, ZZ/XX/YY/XY bonds: each
  contributes 0 individually by F112)
- Dissipator c containing σ⁻_l at rate γ_T1,l and σ⁺_l at rate γ_pump,l
  (amplitude damping / pumping)
- Optional bit_b-homogeneous Z-dephasing (in F112's typed scope, contributes 0)

the F112 polarity asymmetry has the closed form

    asymmetry := ‖M_plus_half‖² − ‖M_minus_half‖²
              = (4^N / 2) · Σ_l ω_l · (γ_pump,l − γ_T1,l)

bit-exactly. Verified at N = 2, 3, 4 via parameter sweep (`simulations/
f113_break_formula_derivation.py`); per-site decomposition, cross-site
zero, sign flip on ω → −ω and on σ⁻ ↔ σ⁺, detailed-balance cancellation
(γ_T1 = γ_pump → 0), and non-uniform-rate sum-formula all confirmed
bit-exact.

**Structural origin:** F112 break requires non-Hermitian Π-eigenspace
coupling between H and c. Only the Z-drive commutator produces this:
[Z, σ⁻] = −2σ⁻ (proportional to the non-Hermitian σ⁻ itself), while
[X, σ⁻] = Z and [Y, σ⁻] = i·Z give Hermitian commutators that remain
F112-symmetric. ZZ/XX/YY bilinears commute differently and produce 0
contribution. Same-site locality of [Z_l, σ⁻_m] = −2σ⁻_m · δ_{lm} gives
the per-site additive structure.

**Universal-N status (Welle 4, 2026-05-26):** Tier 1 derived for general
N via [the F113 coefficient-derivation proof](proofs/PROOF_F113_COEFFICIENT_DERIVATION.md).
The (1/2)·4^N coefficient decomposes structurally as
4 · 4^(N-1) · (1/2):
- factor 4: cross-term reduction `asymmetry = 4 · Re⟨L_H,+i, L_T1,+i⟩`
  (from norm² expansion + F112 typed + F112 non-Hermitian extension
  cancellations + cross-term equal-magnitude-opposite-sign relation).
- factor 4^(N-1): N−1 spectator-site identity factors, each contributing
  ⟨I_4, I_4⟩ = Tr(I_4) = 4 to the Frobenius inner product on tensor
  products. Operator-space dimension entering via local Pauli dimension 4
  per spectator site.
- factor 1/2: single-site N=1 inner product `⟨(L_H,1)_{+i}, (L_T1,1)_{+i}⟩ = −ωγ/2`,
  derived from explicit 4×4 sympy matrices.
The proof's Lemma C is now closed algebraically (PROOF_F113 § "Closure",
two-step: Step C.1 a pure operator-algebra identity
`Tr(A_{+i}B_{-i}) + Tr(A_{-i}B_{+i}) = Tr(A_odd·B_odd)` for any A, B and
unitary Π, then Step C.2 the Lindblad-input vanishing reduced to the single
fact `L_H[I,Z]=0 ↔ [Z,σ_Z]=0`); the general-N Tier1Derived status requires
no numerical anchor (the N=1..5 bit-exact run is now a cross-check, not the
basis).

**Hardware fingerprinting application:** asymmetry measurement directly
extracts Σ_l ω_l · (γ_pump,l − γ_T1,l) when drive parameters are known;
becomes a per-site amplitude-damping calibration tool when combined with
ω_l knowledge. The Welle 2 hardware-fit value for f95 (ω=0.13, γ_T1≈0.001,
γ_pump=0, N=2) gives F113-predicted (1/2)·4² · (2·0.13) · (0 − 0.001) = −2.08e−3
(coefficient (1/2)·4² = 8 at N=2; drive on both q13, q14, so Σ_l ω_l = 2·0.13, the
earlier-notation "16" folds the per-site coefficient 8 together with the two sites),
matching the fitted value bit-exact (the rel asymmetry sign tracked
correctly through both the Python derivation script and the C# pipeline
after the 2026-05-26 convention reconciliation).

**Sister claims:**
- F112 (Tier 1 derived Hermitian H + bit_b-homogeneous c → asymmetry = 0)
  covers the in-scope half of the standard-Lindblad-family polarity
  behavior; F113 covers the bit_b-mixed-c break magnitude. Together they
  give a complete picture across the family.
- F84 amplitude-damping correction (T1 violation of F81 identity):
  F113's σ⁻ contribution is the polarity-axis projection of F84's
  F81-axis violation.

### F114. Commutator Superoperator D-Conjugation Parity (Tier 1 derived, closed form bit-exact N = 1..4)

Closed-form sign functional ε(σ) for the action of D-conjugation on the
H-commutator superoperator L_σ = −i[σ, ·] in the 4^N Pauli basis, where
D = diag((−1)^{n_Y(α)}) is the real diagonal unitary involution that lifts
the Z↔Y dephase-letter swap to operator space (Welle 12: Π_Y = D·Π_Z·D).

**Theorem (F114):** For any single Pauli string σ ≠ I^{⊗N} on N qubits,

    D · L_σ · D = ε(σ) · L_σ    bit-exact

with closed form

    ε(σ) = (−1)^{n_Y(σ) + 1}
         = +1 if n_Y(σ) is odd
         = −1 if n_Y(σ) is even and σ ≠ I^{⊗N}

For σ = I^{⊗N}: L_σ = 0, sign undefined (vacuous case).

For H = Σ_k c_k σ_k a linear combination of Pauli strings: ε(H) is well-
defined and equals ε(σ_k) iff all σ_k share the same n_Y parity. If the
terms split across both parity classes, D-conjugation yields a mixed (non-
multiplicative) response on L_H and no single ε(H) sign exists.

**Why it surfaced:** Welle 15 Task A polish (2026-05-27, commit `a98fc02`)
observed bit-exact at N = 2 that for XZ + ZX bond (n_Y per term = 0)
M_anti(L, Π_Y) = −D · M_anti(L, Π_Z) · D, while YZ + ZY (n_Y per term = 1)
gives +D · M_anti(L, Π_Z) · D. The bond-specific sign motivated systematic
enumeration; the n_Y-parity closed form was identified by
`simulations/m_level_sign_functional_explore.py` (2026-05-27) and verified
bit-exact for all 4^N Pauli strings at N = 1, 2, 3 (84 strings total) plus
the Welle 15 bond bilinears at N = 2 (12 cases) and selected multi-bond /
multi-body cases at N = 3, 4 (6 cases).

**Operational reading:** D acts on L_σ as an automorphism with sign
determined by σ's Y-letter content. Y is the unique Pauli letter that
anticommutes with the antisymmetric transposition convention (σ_Y^T = −σ_Y
while σ_I^T = σ_I, σ_X^T = σ_X, σ_Z^T = σ_Z); the per-letter parity bookkeeping
collapses to a per-string n_Y parity.

**Consequence for F112 / F108 cross-dephase (Welle 13):** the F112-Y M-level
identity

    M(L_H, Π_Y) = ε(H) · D · M(L_H, Π_Z) · D    bit-exact

holds when the dissipator contribution to M vanishes (F112 hypothesis: Hermitian H
plus bit_b-homogeneous c) AND when ε(H) is well-defined (all H Pauli terms share
n_Y parity). This refines the Welle 13 PROOF_F112_CROSS_DEPHASE_VIA_KLEIN_V4
statement "L_Y is not D-transportable" by exhibiting the precise M-level
ε-signed equivariance that survives despite the L-level absence of D-transport.
The F112 typed scope (norm-level ‖M_+1/2‖² = ‖M_−1/2‖²) remains sign-invariant.

**Connection axes:**
- Welle 12 D · Π_Z · D = Π_Y: F114 is the L-level companion. Welle 12 makes
  D the Π swap-operator across {Z, Y} dephase letters; F114 makes D the L_H
  sign-flip-operator with per-term n_Y bookkeeping.
- F112: ε is sign-invariant under the F112 norm-level statement, so F112-Y
  Tier1Derived (via Welle 13 Route 1) and F112 are mutually consistent.
- F108 Part 1+3: Z- and Y-dephase palindrome closures share the Π² bit_b
  grading; F114's ε(H) characterization gives the precise H-side condition
  under which the M_anti structure is signed-equivariant across {Z, Y}.

**Empirical anchor:** `simulations/m_level_sign_functional_explore.py`.
PART 1 enumerates ε(σ) for all 4 + 16 + 64 = 84 single Pauli strings at
N = 1, 2, 3 and verifies the n_Y-parity closed form bit-exact. PART 2
verifies ε(H) for 12 bilinear bond Hamiltonians at N = 2 (XZ+ZX, YZ+ZY,
Heisenberg, single-bond XX/YY/ZZ/XY/YX/ZY/XZ, mixed-letter single-site
combos). PART 3 sanity-checks 6 multi-bond / multi-body cases at N = 3, 4
(chain bond pairs, ZZZ, YYY, XYZ, N=4 Heisenberg chain). All ε predictions
match the actual D-conjugation residual bit-exact (residual = 0.00e+00
numpy double precision).

**Typed Claim:** promoted same wave (2026-05-27, commit `35a88df`) to
`CommutatorDConjugationSign` (Tier1Derived) in
`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/`, ctor parent

via InspectableNode. 35 unit tests including matrix-level `D·L·D = ε·L`
bit-exact verification at N = 2.

**Closed general-N (2026-06-10, the transpose reading).** D is the transpose
superoperator θ(ρ) = ρᵀ written in the Pauli basis, so
D·L_σ·D = θ∘L_σ∘θ = −L_{σᵀ} = (−1)^{n_Y(σ)+1}·L_σ for every σ and every N
in one line (σᵀ = (−1)^{n_Y}σ; Y is the only antisymmetric Pauli). The
girth-ladder reversal kill
([the F87 windowed-converse proof](proofs/PROOF_F87_WINDOWED_MONOMIAL_CONVERSE.md) §4:
word reversal = transpose × (−1)^{n_Y(word)}) is the same antiautomorphism
at word length j; F113 Lemma C is its Hermitian-conjugacy sibling.
Bit-exact anchor: `simulations/mirror_inventory_d4.py`

### F115. Windowed F87 hardness is a closed-form combinatorial theory (Tier 1 derived, GF(2)[x] valuation)

F103 §7 derives the F87 diagonal-cell soft/hard split as a bipartite-chirality mechanism; F115
collapses its combinatorics to closed form. Read a k-body diagonal-cell Mixed term's X/Y positions as
a polynomial p(x) over GF(2) (bit j ↦ x^j), even popcount so (1 + x) | p; the sliding-window builder
places it at windows w = 0 … N−k as the shifts {x^w p}, with W = N − k + 1 windows. Four statements,
all bit-exact.

1. *Hardness is a valuation difference (the one-number criterion).* A Z-dephasing diagonal-cell Mixed
   pair is hard ⟺ v_{1+x}(p₁) ≠ v_{1+x}(p₂), the (1 + x)-adic valuations of the two masks; equal
   valuations ⟹ soft. This is the §7.5 non-bipartite criterion in one subtraction, and it matches the
   actual spectral trichotomy on every k = 3, N = 4 pair (derived for any k via §7.7 + §7.5/§7.6).
   Scope of the Tier-1-derived label: the criterion plus the genericity result (hard for all but
   finitely many γ); the all-γ closure is `WindowedConverseAllGammaClaim` (Tier1Derived since
   2026-06-10, no residual: girth dichotomy + Pascal-Gram positivity F117,
   [the F87 windowed-converse proof](proofs/PROOF_F87_WINDOWED_MONOMIAL_CONVERSE.md)).

2. *Obstruction-size law (two-layered).* The minimal odd 𝔽₂-relation among the shifts (the hardness
   obstruction) has maximal size over hard pairs = min(2W − 1, 2k − 3 − 2d), where d = deg(g_rest) is the
   degree of the shared non-(1 + x) part of g = gcd(p₁, p₂). The window leg 2W − 1 (at most 2W masks, an
   odd subset ≤ 2W − 1); the body leg 2k − 3 − 2d ((1 + x) | p forces the gcd-quotients to degree
   ≤ k − 2 − d, popcount ≤ k − 1 − d). Only (1 + x) governs hard/soft (the unique hardness prime, §7.9);
   the other shared factors shrink the obstruction by 2 per degree. The d = 0 face is 2k − 3; k = 3 gives
   3, the always-triangle case.

3. *Closed-form hard count.* The even-popcount nonzero k-bit masks split by valuation into classes of
   size c_v = 2^{k-1-v} (v = 1 … k−1); a pair is hard iff its masks differ in class, so
   #hard mask-pairs = e₂(2^0, …, 2^{k-2}) = (4^{k-1} − 3·2^{k-1} + 2)/3 = OEIS A203241. Dressed by the
   2^{2k-3} Klein / y-parity factor this is the hard count itself (448, 8960, 158720 at k = 4, 5, 6).
   The count is itself layered by the shared-factor degree d of §7.9: #hard with deg(g_rest) = d =
   2^{d-1}·B(k − d), B(k) = (4^k − 12k + 8)/18 the d = 0 base. The size-3 (triangle) sub-class closes,
   5·2^{k-1} − (3k² + k)/2 − 3; the exact per-size middle counts stay window-dependent.

4. *Coding-theory home.* The obstruction = the minimum ODD weight of the two-generator quasi-cyclic
   (terminated rate-1/2 convolutional) code generated by (a, b) = (p₂/g, p₁/g), g = gcd. The code's free
   distance (any parity) is a constant 4; the palindrome reads the parity-restricted odd floor 2k − 3.
   The minimum-odd-weight invariant is non-standard (coding theory optimizes free distance), so this is
   the correct vocabulary and home, not an imported theorem: the size law and the count are elementary
   (1 + x)-valuation facts. The one genuine coding-theory effect is cancellation (a sparse multiple a·s
   drops the obstruction below the gcd-generator popcount at k ≥ 6), which is what makes the middle-class
   distribution window-dependent.

**Connection to the polarity cube: bit_a is the lowest valuation bit.** The (1 + x)-adic valuation grades
the existing Klein bit_a axis. bit_a = #(X + Y) mod 2 = popcount(mask) mod 2 is exactly [v_{1+x}(mask) = 0],
the lowest bit of the valuation (odd popcount ⟹ v = 0; even popcount ⟹ v ≥ 1). Inside the diagonal cell
(bit_a = 0, bit_b = 1) the valuation keeps grading, v = 1 … k − 1, into the very classes c_v = 2^{k-1-v}
of statement 3, and the hard/soft "Z bit" is the pair-difference v(p₁) ≠ v(p₂). So F115 is not a new
polarity axis: it is the graded refinement of the bit_a axis, read at the pair level inside the bit_b = 1
cell (bit_b selects that cell because the −N reflection mode needs F H F = −H, i.e. odd #Y + #Z). Verified
bit-exact: bit_a = [v = 0] for all masks, and the bit_a = 0 cell's valuation classes reproduce c_v.

The grade reads concretely as a tower of dyadic moments: moment_j is the parity of the X/Y count on the
sites whose index has j as a submask (j AND i == j), moment_0 being bit_a (the total parity), and the
grade is the number of leading vanishing moments, i.e. how deeply the X/Y pattern is dyadically balanced
((1 + x)^{2^m} is a distance-2^m pair, of grade 2^m). So the combinations the grade produces, the §7.8
classes, are the dyadic-balance strata of the X/Y pattern, not bookkeeping. The graded axis is pulled
into the toolkit as C# `BitADyadicGrade` (`compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/`, with `Moment` / `Grade`
/ `BitA`), tested against the GF(2)[x] valuation and the classes c_v.

**Verified:** the valuation criterion vs the actual spectral verdict (k = 3, N = 4, every pair); the
size law across a (k, N) grid through k = 6; the class sizes, count, d = 3 form, and
free-distance-4-vs-odd-weight-2k−3 through k = 10, with the dressed totals matched against the C# scan
at k = 4, 5, 6; the quasi-cyclic dictionary bit-exact k = 4, 5, 6.

### F116. The Golden Ceiling Router (Tier 1 derived: constructive existence, exact arithmetic, every N ≥ 3)

The two Z-middle ceiling cases, H = Σ_windows (XZX+XZY+YZX) and the X↔Y sibling
YZY+XZY+YZX under Z-dephasing, are palindromized by a **per-site product** after all:
the period-4 golden router

  W = ⊗_l q_{l mod 4},   W L W⁻¹ = −L − 2σ,   σ = Σ_l γ_l (site-dependent rates allowed),

with the closed form (φ² = φ + 1, all entries in ℤ[φ]+iℤ[φ]):
g_l = q_l(I) follows [a, a, b, b] with a = φX + Y, b = X − φY; h_l = q_l(Z) =
(−1)^(l+1)·i·R(g_l); q_l(X) = −(g_l)_X·I + (h_l)_X·Z, q_l(Y) = −(g_l)_Y·I + (h_l)_Y·Z.
Each q_l is class-swapping with q_l² = −(2+φ)·I (a scalar times a unitary, cond(W) = 1).
The frame directions are the two roots of the **golden locus α² − αβ − β² = 0**
(slopes 1/φ and −φ; tan 2θ = 2). Two-sided form: W(ρ) = (2+φ)^(N/2)·P ρ Q with product
unitaries P, Q each anticommuting with H (so spec(H) is exactly ±E-symmetric, and
G = PQ is a weak Z₂ symmetry of L and an exact eigenmode at the palindrome floor −2σ).

**Mechanism:** the window-summed anticommutator {Q₃, [XZX+XZY+YZX, ·]₃} = 0 exactly at
every window offset (cross-template cancellation inside one window; per-term it fails,
which is why the per-term certifier search could never see it); window additivity gives
every N ≥ 3. **Exclusion side (derived):** the identity-column functional forces
[H, ⊗g_l] = 0 with per-window equations whose only uniform or period-2 solution is g = 0
(the committed optimization floors are now theorems), period 3 is impossible for N ≥ 5,
and the discrete Klein candidates P1/P4/M2/M sit off the locus (values +1, −1, −1, −1/2).
**Rigidity:** zero continuous moduli; the invertible solution set at N=5 is exhaustively
4 cyclic shifts × an explicit order-32 sign group, all golden. The ceiling arc closes
6 → 4 → 2 → **0**: no case in the k=3 windowed soft family needs a non-local mirror.
Open chains only (rings untested).

**Verified:** {W,A} = 0 and the window lemma EXACT over ℤ[φ]+iℤ[φ] at N = 3..6 (both
siblings); end-to-end vs the framework Lindbladian at N = 5, 6, γ ∈ {0.3, 0.7, 1.0} and
site-dependent rates (rel ~2e-16); independently re-implemented five ways (through N = 9
sampled) in the 2026-06-10 adversarial audit.

**The metallic family (2026-06-11):** the golden point is the c = 1 member of a
one-real-parameter line. For weighted templates t₁·XZX + t₂·XZY + t₃·YZX the soft set
is exactly **t₂ = t₃** (off-line is hard by the girth ladder; witness (1,2,1) fires at
m\* = 11 with p₁₁ = 1730150400·γ³ exact). On the line, with c = t₁/t₂, the same
[a, a, b, b] router works with a = (r, 1), b = (1, −r), **r(c) = (c + √(c²+4))/2 the
metallic mean** (golden c=1, silver c=2, bronze c=3; r(−c) = 1/r(c) so c=−1 is 1/φ;
c=0 is the 45° diagonal), q_l² = −(1+r²)·I. **Derived for ALL real c** by degree bound
+ exact interpolation: every entry of r·{Q₃,[T_c,·]₃} is a degree ≤ 5 polynomial in r
(c = r − 1/r), and exact Fraction arithmetic finds 8 rational nodes identically zero,
so the window lemma is a polynomial identity in r. The exclusion generalizes: the
identity-column determinant factors as **c·(α² − cαβ − β²)**, so the metallic locus
gates the frame for every c ≠ 0 (alternation forced, uniform/period-2 empty, zero
moduli verified at silver), while at **c = 0 the determinant dies and a modulus is
born**: the partner map degenerates to the X-axis mirror (α, β) ↦ (α, −β), the parity
chains decouple, the Pauli axes give period-2 uniform-frame routers, and the Jacobian
counts 8 physical moduli (16 = 8 gauge + 8; golden and silver count exactly 8 = gauge).

### F117. Pascal-Gram positivity: every class at the first asymmetric moment is a sum of squares (Tier 1 derived; closes the windowed converse with no residual)

For a windowed diagonal-cell pair, recenter the dephased Liouvillian as M = A + γQ
(A = −i[H,·], Q = Σ_l Z_l ⊗ Z_l) and let m\* be the first odd m whose power-sum
polynomial p_m(γ) = Tr(M^m) is not identically zero. Then **every** γ-coefficient of
p_{m\*} is non-negative: for each #Q class d, either P_{m\*,d} = 0 exactly, or

  P_{m\*,d} = (m\*/d) · Σ_{l⃗ ∈ [N]^d} Σ_{k⃗} |U^{(l⃗)}_{k⃗}|²,
  U^{(l⃗)}_{k⃗} = Σ_{|α⃗| = u} ∏_i C(α_i, k_i) · T^{(l⃗)}_{α⃗},   u = (m\* − d)/2,

with T^{(l⃗)}_{α⃗} = Tr(Z_{l₁}H^{α₁}Z_{l₂}H^{α₂}···Z_{l_d}H^{α_d}) the **d-leg moments**
of H. Since at least one class is positive, p_{m\*}(γ) > 0 for every γ > 0: **hard at one
γ is hard at all γ**, the windowed converse with no residual (this resolved R-sign, the
last residual, on 2026-06-10; the same day's girth dichotomy had retired R-deg). The d = 1
face is the girth-dichotomy sum of squares P_{2ℓ+1,1} = (2ℓ+1)·C(2ℓ,ℓ)·Σ_l t_ℓ²; the ℓ = 1
face of that is F87's P_{3,1} = 6·4^N·Σ_l c_l², and that m = 3 face is **cell-free** (the
companion coefficients of p₃ vanish for every Hermitian H, no diagonal-cell premise:
any H with a single-site-Z component breaks the palindrome at every γ > 0;
[`simulations/f87_deg1_face_cell_free.py`](../simulations/f87_deg1_face_cell_free.py),
the PTF Π-break Z-row made theorem-grade).

**Proof chain (all steps exact):** cyclic decomposition P_{m,d} = (m/d)·Σ_{a⃗} Tr(QA^{a₁}···QA^{a_d});
leg factorization (A_L, A_R commute, supertrace splits bra × ket); Hermitian conjugacy
(ket leg = conj of bra leg at the same indices, the transpose-trick sibling of F113 Lemma C);
leg parity (F-chirality: only odd totals) + leg girth (totals ≥ ℓ); Vandermonde assembly
(C(α+β, β) = Σ_k C(α,k)C(β,k) per slot, prefactor (−i)^u(+i)^u = +1); slice inversion
(U at |k⃗| = u **is** T, so a vanished Gram block kills every total-u moment); cascade
induction (p_m ≡ 0 below m\* ⟹ all lower-total moments vanish ⟹ no cross terms at m\*).

**Selection rule (corollary):** classes fire at m\* only for d ≡ m\* − 2 (mod 4) and
d ≤ m\* − 2ℓ. For deg = m\* − 2ℓ ∈ {1, 3} that is a single class: **monomiality is derived**
at the first two ladder rungs. From deg = 5 two classes may coexist (positivity carries
alone); the γ⁵ witness IIXY+ZXZY happens to be single because its t₅ = 0 too.

**Verified (exact, zero diff):** d = 1 (IXXZ+XIXZ, 573440 = 7·C(6,3)·Σt₃²), d = 3
(K3 2064384, flux 589824, multi-Z 61440), d = 5 (IIXY+ZXZY, 86507520), the cascade's
forced zeros, the slice inversion, and the selection rule on all five representatives.

### F118. The mirror group: Π = R·D, the dihedral D₄, and the cube of characters (Tier 1 derived; signed-permutation identities, exact)

The canonical palindromizer is not elementary. On the coherence space of an N-qubit chain,
with F = X^⊗N, define the ket reflection R(ρ) = ρ·F (the windowed-converse spine's
reflection, I ⊗ F in row-stacking vec) and the transpose D(ρ) = ρᵀ (on the Pauli basis
exactly F114's diagonal sign diag((−1)^{n_Y})). Then, with D applied first,

  Π_Z = R ∘ D,   Π_Z(ρ) = ρᵀ·X^⊗N,

per site σ ↦ σᵀ·X, reproducing the April rule I → X, X → I, Y → iZ, Z → iY with no extra
phase: the hard-won factors i fall out of Yᵀ = −Y meeting YX = −iZ. The opposite order IS
the other palindromizer, Π_Y = D ∘ R: ρ ↦ F·ρᵀ = Π_Z⁻¹, so Welle 12's identity
D·Π_Z·D = Π_Y is the dihedral inversion relation s·r·s = r⁻¹ in disguise.

**The group:** ⟨R, D⟩ ≅ D₄, eight signed permutations, every one already in use plus one
never named: rotations {I, Π_Z, 𝓕 = Π_Z² = F1², Π_Y = Π_Z³}; diagonal mirrors
{D = diag((−1)^{n_Y}), 𝓕D = diag((−1)^{n_Z})}, literally the diagonal matrices of the
Pauli basis; edge mirrors {R: ρ ↦ ρ·F, 𝓕R: ρ ↦ F·ρ}, the spine's one-sided reflections.
The spine's involution set {I, 𝓕, R, 𝓕R} is a Klein four-subgroup of D₄; the center is 𝓕,
the charge conjugation. (Where the center already lives, unnamed since May: the Object
Manager's memory trio walks it, `MemoryAxisChain`'s Π²-partition and `MemoryAxisRho`'s
static/even/odd split are central-character readings, and `BlochAxisReading`'s
dominant-axis rule is the per-qubit central character; noted 2026-06-10.)

**The palindrome splits along the generators.** D flips the Hamiltonian commutator
(D·L_H·D = −L_H, F114's ε(H) = −1 in action) and fixes the dissipator; R fixes L_H and
reflects the dissipator, carrying the entire constant: R·L_diss·R = −L_diss − 2σ·I with
σ = Σ_l γ_l, because flipping the ket index complements the lit-site set. April multiplied
the generators (Π = R·D, one conjugation, the full palindrome); June kept them apart
(𝓕 = (RD)², R, the spine's sign table). Same two generators, two angles.

**The cube of characters.** The polarity cube's three axes (`KleinEightCellClaim`, the
F102-F111 family) are the characters of two conjugations and the transpose:

  bit_a = (n_X + n_Y) mod 2  is the character of Ad_{Z^⊗N},
  bit_b = (n_Y + n_Z) mod 2  is the character of Ad_{X^⊗N},
  y_par = n_Y mod 2          is the character of the transpose θ.

Conjugating by any Pauli string flips exactly the two letter parities that anticommute with
it, so unitary mirrors span only the even Klein square {1, (−1)^{n_X+n_Y}, (−1)^{n_Y+n_Z},
(−1)^{n_X+n_Z}}; the transpose is the unique odd move (Y is the only antisymmetric Pauli)
and fills the third dimension, with θ∘Ad_{Z^⊗N} = (−1)^{n_X} and θ∘Ad_{X^⊗N} = (−1)^{n_Z}.
That is why y_par was always the strange third axis: the F102-F111 family worked on the
antiautomorphism dimension, invisible to every unitary conjugation, and needed its own
tools. The truly criterion (n_Y even AND n_Z even) is the **joint-fixed cell** of the
diagonal mirror pair: σ is truly iff both D and 𝓕D fix it. And 𝓕D = diag((−1)^{n_Z}),
acting as ρ ↦ F·ρᵀ·F, is the fourth mirror, named here for the first time: its character
carried the second leg of the truly criterion for weeks before the operator was ever
written down.

**Deliberately outside:** K₁ (grades by site, not by letter), the golden router W (F116;
two-sided, non-involutive, covering exactly the n_Z-odd ceiling territory that D₄'s
class-swapping elements cannot enter), F71's bond mirror (spatial, site k ↔ N+1−k), and
the dephase-letter swaps Q_zx / Q_yx (the Z↔Y swap is D itself, which is Welle 12; the
other two need the X↔Z basis move). Adjoining the letter group S₃ would assemble the
expected full mirror group **S₃ ⋉ D₄**; that completion is named open.

**Verified (exact):** group closure |⟨R, D⟩| = 8, the factorization Π_Z = R·D, the dihedral
relations, and all eight Pauli-basis forms at dev 0.00e+00 (N = 3, signed permutations
compare exactly); the action Π_Z(ρ) = ρᵀ·F on random ρ at N = 1..3 with the wrong-sided
F·ρᵀ rejected at O(1); the palindrome generator rows on XXZ Δ = 0.7 with site-dependent γ
at ≤ 5.6·10⁻¹⁷; the truly-cell equivalence 63/63 strings; the cube characters on all 64
strings at N = 3; F114 spot check at N = 5.

### F119. The antilinear triangle: θ, conj, † as one Klein four-group, and the transport law (Tier 1 derived; one-line identities, universal N)

The transpose θ(A) = Aᵀ, the entrywise conjugation conj(A) = Ā, and the adjoint
†(A) = A† satisfy † = θ∘conj and form, with the identity, a Klein four-group graded by
two ±1 characters: **ℓ (linearity)** and **m (multiplicativity)**. θ = (linear,
reversing), conj = (antilinear, preserving), † = (antilinear, reversing). On a Pauli
string: θ(σ) = conj(σ) = (−1)^{n_Y}σ, †(σ) = σ. The engine is the **transport law**

  μ ∘ L_H ∘ μ = ℓ(μ)·m(μ) · L_{μ(H)},   L_H = −i[H,·], any H,

the sign being the product character: θ → −L_{Hᵀ}, conj → −L_{H̄}, † → +L_{H†} (its two
signs cancel). One sign from the −i (antilinearity), one from the commutator's order
(reversal); the dephasing dissipator is fixed by all three. **Five proofs, one engine:**
F114 is the θ face at word length 2; the girth-ladder reversal kill is θ at word length
j (Tr reversed = (−1)^{n_Y}·Tr forward); F112 Lemmas A+B are the † face at the
Hilbert-Schmidt pairing ((L_H)\* = −L_{H†}, the dagger an antilinear isometry
conjugating Π-eigenvalues, and the skew/self-adjoint split under this pairing is the
Absorption Theorem's Rayleigh floor); F113 Lemma C / F117's Hermitian conjugacy is the
**fixed-point collapse** (each vertex's fixed-point set is where the other two agree:
H = H† ⟺ Hᵀ = H̄, ket leg = conj of bra leg); the K₁/K_b mirrors T = Σ₁∘conj are the
conj face dressed on a coherence block (antilinearity pairs λ ↔ λ̄, hence mode k ↔
N+1−k). In the Pauli basis the triangle docks onto F118's mirror group: θ = D, † = the
antilinear unit 𝒦, conj = D∘𝒦, and the closure is the **antilinear double**
⟨R, D, 𝒦⟩ ≅ D₄ × Z₂ (order 16, eight antiunitary members). The dial trio points at the
open S₃ ⋉ D₄ completion: θ and conj invert every rotation dial (the O(2) reflections of
each thickened circle), † commutes with every unitary conjugation.

**Qudit generalization (§6):** on the Weyl-Heisenberg operators P_{a,b} = X^a Z^b (a, b ∈ Z_d) the three involutions act with a symplectic phase, θ(P_{a,b}) = ω^{−ab}P_{−a,b}, conj(P_{a,b}) = P_{a,−b}, †(P_{a,b}) = ω^{ab}P_{−a,−b} (ω = e^{2πi/d}); the transport law is basis-free at every d; the qubit (−1)^{n_Y} is the d = 2 degeneration (ω^{ab} at the one label (1,1) = Y where the a ↦ −a flip collapses), and for d > 2 the triangle is a reflection of the Z_d × Z_d lattice, dovetailing with F121's Z_d ≀ Z₂.

**Verified (exact):** the V₄ table and Pauli action; the transport law for all four
vertices on non-Hermitian H (machine-exact, N = 2, 3); each leg re-derived from the
engine and cross-checked against its home formulation; the order-16 closure with
exactly 8 antilinear members (N = 2); the dial trio at a generic angle.

### F120. The moment-tower pump channel: the device's own damping reads the girth ladder linearly (Tier 1 derived; structural law confirmed on ibm_kingston 2026-06-11)

Amplitude damping is the standard noise model's unique non-unital piece, and its pump
direction is a pure local Z (D[σ⁻_l](I) = +Z_l, D[σ⁺_l](I) = −Z_l, the same (Z_l, I)
entry that is F82's entire Π²-antisymmetric content), so at the maximally mixed state

  **d/dt ⟨A⟩ |_{ρ=I/d} = (1/d) · Σ_l Δγ_l · Tr(A Z_l),   Δγ_l = γ↓_l − γ↑_l,**

exactly, for every A and every H. With A = H^j the slope is (1/d)·Σ_l Δγ_l·**t_j(l)**:
the girth ladder's deg-1 tower t_j(l) = Tr(Z_l H^j), read LINEARLY, rung by rung, by
nothing but the chip's own damping. Three exact blindnesses: dephasing-blind (unital),
evolution-blind (only the measured polynomial enters), detailed-balance closure (the
weight is F84's net vacuum rate). **Rung one is F113**: within F113's scope the static
Frobenius polarity asymmetry equals **−4^N · slope⟨H⟩** exactly (a static spectral
imbalance IS a measurable pump rate). The first firing rung is the girth ℓ, certifying
**hard at m\* = 2ℓ+1 for every γ > 0** (the F117 deg-1 sum of squares); honestly
one-sided: silence is not softness (IIXY+ZXZY is silent at every rung, hard at m\* = 11
through deg-5). One order up the curvature is exactly affine in the generator and reads
X/Y-flavored parasites linearly against the commutator probes [Z_l, H_p^j], while
Z-flavored parasites are exactly invisible: **F113's balance channel and the pump
curvature partition the single-site parasite algebra** into complementary linear
readers. Hardware protocol (derived, parameter-free from T1 calibration): basis-state
averaging, early-window slopes of Pauli-polynomial energy moments, per-site partial
damping for site resolution.

**Verified (exact):** pump directions and the law vs dense generators (N = 2, 3,
site-dependent rates, all three channels); the blindnesses; the three-way F113 bridge
(closed form = polarity decomposition = −4^N·slope, dev 0); girth-1/girth-2 witnesses
plus the honest deg-5 negative control; curvature affinity + the probe law + the
Z-invisibility; the finite-time protocol fit; detailed-balance closure.

**First hardware reading (2026-06-11, ibm_kingston q149/q13/q9, not one entangling
gate):** the structural law CONFIRMED: the double null held (slope⟨H⟩ at z = +1.47 and
−0.04), the second rung fired as exactly twice the middle qubit's pump (row-exact
⟨H²⟩ identity), the girth read from hardware is 2, site tracking across two arms, and
per-qubit pump rates reproducible to 0.3-5.7%. The rate layer told a two-act story:
the first reading ("q13 violates pump ≤ Γ at 4-6σ") was **corrected the same day** by
the prep-conditioned re-analysis: the 8-basis-state preparation contains the |0⟩- and
|1⟩-branches, so **pump = (s₁+s₀)/2 and Γ = (s₁−s₀)/2 come from the same circuits**,
epoch-matched (the bound is equivalent to s₀ ≤ 0), and it **holds everywhere in-situ**
(worst pump/Γ = 0.996) with 1-3% margins that read the per-qubit thermal population
(q13 1.7%, q149 1.1-1.4%, q9 0.2-0.3%). The cross-epoch comparison had actually
detected **minute-scale T1 telegraphing** (q13: ~315 ↔ 430 μs; q9: ~172 ↔ ~75-100 μs;
q149 stable): two-level Lindblad holds within epochs, the epoch was the hidden
variable, and the protocol is **self-arbitrating** (pump, Γ, γ↑ from one circuit set).

### F121. The qudit partial palindrome: the symmetric overlap of the disagreement count (Tier 1 derived; closed-form combinatorial identity, resolves OQ-002)

The palindromic mirror is exact only at d = 2 (F-trunk d² − 2d = 0; the per-site balance
d = d² − d closes only there). For d > 2 the spectrum is not random but partial: N = 2
qutrits pair 36–52 of 81 eigenvalues, a residual no principle had captured. Here is the
principle. Under full-Cartan dephasing the d levels are **equidistant**, so the decay rate
of a coherence |i⟩⟨j| is exactly −2γ·Hamming(i, j), the **same rate ladder as the qubit**
(the Absorption Theorem one dimension up). What differs is the multiplicity per rung:

  **c_k = d^N · C(N, k) · (d−1)^k**   (coherences at Hamming distance k),   Σ_k c_k = d^{2N}.

The palindrome reflects rung k ↔ N−k. For d = 2 the factor (d−1)^k = 1, c_k = 2^N·C(N, k)
is symmetric, all pair (100%). For d > 2 the (d−1)^k tilts toward large k and only the
overlap pairs; the dissipator's paired ceiling is

  **paired(d, N) = Σ_k d^N · C(N, k) · (d−1)^{min(k, N−k)},**

equal to d^{2N} **iff d = 2** (the unique fully-paired column of an N-family; this is the
d² − 2d = 0 necessity re-seen). For d = 3, N = 2: c = [9, 36, 36], rung 0 pairs into rung 2
leaving 27, rung 1 self-mirrors, paired = **54/81**, excess 27. The qutrit fraction erodes
with N (66.7%, 66.7%, 51.9% for N = 1, 2, 3); d = 4 gives 50%, 50%, 31.2%. The tilt base
d − 1 is exactly the per-site decaying : immune ratio (d² − d) : d, raised to the number of
disagreeing sites.

**The interacting spectrum (H degrades it):** the ceiling is the *dissipator's* palindrome
about the physical center −Nγ. Adding H reduces the pairing at **every** fixed center (54 → 48
about −Nγ = −2γ; 72 → 60 about −3γ, where the two large rungs sit); the palindrome is fragile
under H. For the symmetric SU(3) Heisenberg the real parts lie exactly on Re(λ) = −2γ⟨Q⟩ (the
Absorption Theorem's Rayleigh reading), with ⟨Q⟩ quantized to {0, 1, 1.5, 2}: the new −3γ rung
is ⟨Q⟩ = 1.5, a Hamming-1/Hamming-2 mix. This exactness is a symmetry effect (a generic H
breaks it). The interacting paired count is H-dependent (60 for SU(3) Heisenberg, robust across
J/γ; ~0 for generic H), so there is **no H-independent closed form** for the interacting
palindrome; the dissipator's 54 (about −Nγ) is the only invariant. The SU(3)
Heisenberg's specific 60 is **decoded by representation theory** (§8): the operator
space splits into SU(3) energy sectors (intra 6⊗6̄ ⊕ 3̄⊗3 at L_H = 0, inter 6↔3̄ at
L_H = ±iΔ with Δ = 4J), the −3γ rung (⟨Q⟩ = 3/2) is exactly the inter-sector sym↔antisym seam,
and 60 = (energy sectors) × (Hamming rungs) × (±Δ conjugation).

**Verified (exact):** the per-site equidistance (every i ≠ j at rate −2); c_k vs brute
enumeration (d = 3, N = 2 and d = 2, N = 3); the dissipator spectrum {0:9, −2γ:36, −4γ:36}
and its 54/81 pairing; the ceiling formula vs brute combinatorial pairing on the (d, N) ∈
{2,3,4}×{1,2,3} grid; d = 2 full in every column.

**The operator realization (2026-06-11, same day, §6 of the proof):** the count gained its
operator. **Product cap (theorem):** any per-site mirror W = ⊗q_l (site-dependent, one- or
two-sided, antilinear allowed) intertwining the dissipator palindrome pairs at most
**(2d)^N** of the d^{2N} coherences (rate additivity forces strict per-site class swap;
rank ≤ 2·min(d, d²−d) = 2d); full ⟺ (2d)^N = d^{2N} ⟺ **d² − 2d = 0**, the trunk's third
appearance. The cap is attained by the qubit palindromizer's verbatim formula
**Π_d(ρ) = ρᵀ·Shift^⊗N** (clock shift), exactly zero residual on the shift-aligned
(2d)^N-dim subspace (per-site {(x,x)} ∪ {(a, a−1)}); two chiralities Π_d^±, which merge at
d = 2 (the two off-diagonals coincide): the qubit's full mirror IS that degeneracy. The gap
to the combinatorial ceiling (18 at d = 3, N = 2) is reached by a global partial isometry
and is therefore **provably the non-product part** (the inverse of the F116 story: here the
locality obstruction is real). Group law, verified d = 2..5: ord(Π_d) = 2d,
**|⟨Π_d, D⟩| = 2d², ⟨Π_d, D⟩ ≅ Z_d ≀ Z₂** (D-conjugation exchanges the two shift factors;
for d > 2 it swaps the chiralities): **F118's D₄ is the d = 2 column of a wreath family.** The
non-product gap is **translation-invariant**: a [W, T] = 0 palindrome intertwiner has generic
rank equal to the full ceiling (54, 378, 128 at (3,2), (3,3), (4,2)), strictly above the
product cap, so there is **no intermediate layer** (§7); the hierarchy is two-tiered (product
vs translation-invariant = ceiling), gated by d² − 2d = 0, the F116 story inverted.

### F122. The structural ceiling: closed forms for the topology gap rate (Tier 1 derived; principal-angle proof + gate-exact N=4..8; 2026-06-16)

Under uniform Z-dephasing the slowest non-steady mode sits at `Re = −2γ·g2` with
`g2 = ⟨n_XY⟩` of that mode (the Absorption Theorem). The chain has `g2 = 1` (the
single-excitation band edge `|vac⟩⟨ψ_k|`, `n_XY = 1`, is slowest). More connected graphs
grow a darker `[H,A]=0` coherence below the band edge, a **structural ceiling** `g2 < 1`:

  **g2(K_N) = 4/N**  (N ≥ 5),    **g2(star_N) = 4/(N−1)**  (N ≥ 6),    **g2(K_4) = 2 − 2/√3.**

*Mechanism* (high-Q degenerate PT): the decay rates are the eigenvalues of `N_XY`
(diagonal in the coherence basis, entry `hamming(a,b)`) block-diagonalized by the `ad_H`
eigenspaces. The band edge is the `(0,1)` sector where `hamming ≡ 1`, so `N_XY = I` and the
rate is `2γ` exactly at all Q (`g2 ≤ 1` always). The ceiling is the darkest coherence in the
largest *degenerate single-particle level*. For `K_N` that is the `(N−1)`-fold `−J` band (the
`S_N` standard rep): `g2 = 2(1 − λ₂)` with `λ₂ = (N−2)/N` the second principal-angle overlap
between the H-commutant and the population (diagonal) operators, giving `4/N`. For the star it
is the `(N−2)`-fold `0`-eigenvalue leaf manifold, giving `4/(N−1)` by the same computation.
Gate-exact: `K_{5,6,7} = 4/5, 2/3, 4/7`; `star_{6,7,8} = 4/5, 4/6, 4/7` (`<10⁻⁹`).

*Connectivity onset* (chain never `<` star `N≥6` `<` complete `N≥5`) is the growth of that
degeneracy with edge count. *`N = 4` outlier*: the `4/N` ladder hits `1` at `N = 4`, so the
ceiling is set instead by the `(2,2)` half-filling sector, the **same sector that makes ring-4
special** (`K_4 = 2 − 2/√3 < 1` dips below the floor; ring-4 `= 1` co-occupies it). One
mechanism, two topologies. *Not universal*: the tempting `4/(m+1)` in the degeneracy `m` fits
complete + star but the ring (Fourier-degenerate manifold) breaks it. The ring in fact has **no
ceiling at all**: a full (p,q)-sector sweep gives global high-Q `g2 = 1` at every N=4..11
(band-edge-protected like the chain), because its only degeneracy is the weak 2-fold Fourier
pairing `k ↔ −k`, too little to build a dark `[H,A]=0` coherence below the band edge. The flagged
`ring-5 = 1.6 ≠ 4/3` is the `(1,1)` commutant, which sits ABOVE the band edge (so it is not the
ceiling) and itself has a closed form: `2(N−2)/N` (even N) / `2(N−1)/N` (odd N), both `→ 2` (the
darkest single-excitation commutant coherence grows brighter, not darker; the even/odd split is
the singleton count, two self-paired modes `k=0, N/2` for even vs one `k=0` for odd). For even N
the half-filling `(N/2,N/2)` commutant equals the `(1,1)` value (a ring sector degeneracy); ring-4
`= 1` co-occupies the band edge, the lone N=4 anomaly. The per-family forms are the result, the
degeneracy is only the intuition. This corrects the band-edge arc's tentative "star saturates at
0.80, N-independent" (`0.80 = 4/5` was `N=6` only).

### F123. The closure functional: the survivor's bond rate shift is the squared density gradient (Tier 1 candidate; diffusion Rayleigh quotient, gate-exact N=4..7; 2026-06-19)

The longest-lived mode on a dispersive chain is the half-filling **survivor**, whose single-site occupation
profile `n(j)` is a standing density wave. The survivor is **predominantly** a density mode (a dominant
real diagonal carrying `n(j)`) dressed by a rate-bearing Hamming-2 coherence admixture: the HD-0 diagonal
is **dark** (`⟨n_XY⟩ = 0`) and the decay rate `−2γ⟨n_XY⟩` is carried by the HD-2 coherence; `Tr(M†H_b) = 0`
rules out only nearest-neighbour hopping (the single-particle `φ·φ` current picture), not diagonality. Under
a single-bond defect `δJ` on bond `b = (j, j+1)`, the first-order shift of its decay rate is the **squared
density gradient** across that bond:

  **∂(Re λ)/∂J_b ∝ (n(j) − n(j+1))²**

*Mechanism* (the secular effective theory, the coherence admixture eliminated into a population diffusion):
the slow density `n(j)` decays through `Re λ ∝ −Σ_b D_b·(n(j) − n(j+1))² / ‖n‖²`, so `∂/∂D_b` (Hellmann-Feynman on the real-symmetric reduced Laplacian) selects the local squared gradient. The shift is
therefore ≈ 0 at the no-flux (reflecting) chain **ends** (the gradient vanishes there) and maximal in the
**interior**, mirror-symmetric. Its bond-*shape* is **Q-invariant** (set by the lowest diffusion harmonic
`k_min`); the overall rate scale is not.

*Verification* (the engine itself, `inspect --root gradient --N 5 --q …`): the slope of `dRe` against
`|grad|` `→ 2.00` and `CV → 0` as `Q → 0` (the exact diffusion limit, off-diagonal weight `→ 0`), and drifts
above 2 as the finite-`Q` coherence dressing grows (`2.12` at `Q=1.5`, `2.39` at `Q=2.0`, a finite-`Q`
effect, not a boundary one), until the handover `Q* ≈ 2.5` where the survivor becomes the rigid `(0,1)` band
edge and the law no longer applies. The continuum `sin²` shape-miss converges with N (`0.17 → 0.06`). The
earlier single-particle `φ·φ` candidate used the wrong standing wave (the survivor is multi-magnon): right
power, wrong wave.

*Trajectory dual*: the PTF painter closure `Σ_i ln(α_i)` reads this same rate shift where it reads
cleanly, sign-coherent only at the high-gradient bonds (matching `N·|dRe|/|reS|` in sign and `O(1)`
magnitude; the low-gradient bonds read as a redistribution): the eigenvalue law (this entry) and the
trajectory closure (the stone) are one fact read twice.

### F124. The band-edge transition matrix: a Dirichlet-edge coupling fixes the Frobenius deficit and the spectral floor (Tier 1 derived; gate-exact N=3..20; open chain, band-edge carrier; 2026-06-20)

For the open chain, the **full single-excitation bond-transition matrix** `M[b,k] = ⟨ψ_k|V_b|ψ_1⟩` (rows = bonds, cols = **all** `N` modes `k=1..N`, carrier `ψ_1` = the band-edge / F67-receiver mode, `V_b` the single-bond perturbation) satisfies

  **‖M‖_F² + λ_min(M Mᵀ) = z = 2,**  exactly, all `N`,

with `‖M‖_F² = z − E` and `λ_min = E`, where `z = 2` is the chain's **coordination number** and `E = c₀² + c_{N-1}² = (4/(N+1))·sin²(π/(N+1))` is the carrier's weight on the two free ends; the `λ_min` eigenvector is the staggered bond wave `(−1)^b`.

The non-trivial content is **`λ_min = E`**: a staggered (zone-boundary, `q=π`) bond modulation couples to the band-edge carrier **only through the Dirichlet ends**, the bulk cancels identically via the conserved discrete-energy envelope `Q = c_a²+c_{a+1}²−E₁ c_a c_{a+1} = c₀²` (`E₁ = 2cos(π/(N+1))`, the band edge / `ClockHandLadder`), an **SSH/Peierls edge effect**; this same `E` is the deficit of the carrier's degree-weighted norm from `z`. One boundary quantity `c₀²` fixes both. The "2" itself is the coordination number (basis-independent degree-counting, riding on `‖V_b‖²=2`), **not** a conservation constant.

**Frame reading** (grounding-in-the-quantum + borrowing-a-discipline converged): `{V_bψ_1}` is a **deficient, non-tight Riesz basis**, rank `N−1`, kernel = the K-partner `ψ_N` (the typed `KPartnerSelectionRuleClaim`); `λ_min` = the **lower frame bound** = the **Eckart-Young distance-to-singularity²** = the worst-case reconstruction floor; the end-leakage `E` is the **conditioner**, condition number `λ_max/E` (shorter chains better-conditioned).

**Caveats / scope.** Band-edge carrier **only** (other carriers → sum `< 2`, selected by the positivity of the off-diagonals, not the carrier-independent envelope). The decoder's *location dictionary* `k=2..N` (strength channel excluded) does **not** satisfy this (sum ≠ 2, `λ_min = 0 =` the K-partner null column); the clean `2` needs the `k=1` strength column, so this is the **full transition matrix**, not the location reading. Topology: chain + even ring hold (the even ring degenerately, `E=0`); odd ring frustrates (`λ_min>0`); star breaks (hub, `‖M‖_F²=N/2`). `M` is distinct from the F1/F49 residual `M`.

**Resolution-limit reading** (the optics/signal facet, 2026-06-20): the same `M` read as a bond-recovery inverse problem has a defect-localization resolution limit. `λ_min = E = σ_min²(M)` is the worst-case reconstruction floor (the lower frame bound); the condition number `κ = λ_max/λ_min ~ N²` is the noise amplification; the contrast `σ_max/σ_min = √κ ~ N` is how many times harder a staggered q=π zone-boundary defect is to localize than a band-edge one (matched-filter SNR); the worst-conditioned direction is the staggered `λ_min` eigenvector (the q=π detail at the cutoff, the optician's diffraction limit); the floor vanishes as `σ_min ~ (N+1)^(−3/2)`, `E·(N+1)³ → 4π²`. One object in three trades (inverse problem / observability Gramian / optics MTF). **Typed:** `BandEdgeResolutionLimitClaim` (Tier1Derived, parent `BandEdgeTransitionInvariantClaim`) + live witness `inspect --root resolution`; gate-first verifier [`f124_inverse_problem_gate.py`](../simulations/f124_inverse_problem_gate.py). This is the FINITE conditioning of the full matrix, NOT the `DefectDecoder`'s 1.5 sign-location ambiguity (an α-rescaling artifact, gate-refuted; see the `f124_inverse_problem_resolution_seam` arc). Now de-lossed: `DefectDecoder.DecodeDeviation` reads the signed per-site purity-deviation profile and resolves the N=5 mirror pair with the correct sign (squared residual ratio ≈516 vs the α path's ≈1.5); the arc is Retired.

### F125. The spectator intertwiner: the site-summed W carries the Jordan block up the diamond (Theorem B + containment corollary Tier 1 derived; Theorem A two-regime, AT-half derived, residual half conditional; gate machine-zero N=5; 2026-07-02)

For the N-site XY chain (Δ=0, open ends, arbitrary bond profile `J_b`) under local Z-dephasing (arbitrary rates `γ_j`), define with the Jordan-Wigner **site** fermions `c_l` (strings included) the site-summed spectator

  **W(ρ) = Σ_l c_l† ρ c_l,**  mapping the joint-popcount block (p,q̃) → (p+1,q̃+1).

**The intertwiner identity (Theorem B), part by part.** W intertwines the full Liouvillian exactly, as two separate operator identities:

  **D∘W = W∘D**  (dissipator part: `Z_j c_l† Z_j = (1−2δ_{jl})·c_l†` and the sign SQUARES away because the same `l` sits on both sides of ρ; holds per site j, hence for any site-dependent `γ_j`), and

  **[H, W(ρ)] = W([H, ρ])**  (Hamiltonian part: index cancellation of the h-sums, for ANY quadratic particle-conserving `H = Σ h_{ml} c_m†c_l`, no symmetry of h; disorder and on-site potentials included).

Since the block pencil `L(q) = A + q·C` is linear in q, the relation holds for all q iff it holds for A and C separately (gate: both part-residuals `0.00e+00` at N=5). Two traps recorded once: the strings matter (`Σ_l σ_l⁺ρσ_l⁻` is a different map and fails the H-part) and the site sum matters (the single-mode spectator `V_k(ρ) = c_k†ρc_k` has its H-part exact but provably FAILS the dissipator: the cross-site signs do not square away and distinct output coherences forbid cancellation; A-part residual O(1) for every k).

**Jordan transport (the sharp premise).** If `L₂W = WL₁` and `x₁, …, x_m` is a Jordan chain of L₁ at λ with **`Wx₁ ≠ 0`** (x₁ the eigenvector), then `Wx₁, …, Wx_m` is a Jordan chain of L₂ at the SAME λ. Kernel hits are downward-closed along a chain, so `Wx₁ ≠ 0` is necessary AND sufficient; the weakening "`Wx_m ≠ 0` suffices" is FALSE (2×2 nilpotent counterexample). On the climbing rung (1,2)→(2,3), W is injective with `σ_min(W) = √2` at N=5 (gate-pinned), so the ENTIRE spectrum with Jordan structure embeds: the multi-sector census's byte-identical λ IS this embedding. `W†(σ) = Σ_l c_l σ c_l†` is also exact, (p,q̃) → (p−1,q̃−1): depth equality where both kernel conditions pass.

**Containment orbit corollary (the diamond, containment direction ONLY).** The orbit of (1,2) under {one climbing W-step, the transpose (p,q̃)↔(q̃,p), the Klein full flip X^⊗N, the F89d cross-fold q̃↦N−q̃ at q̄} reproduces the census braid sets exactly: the |p−q̃|=1 band united with its cross-fold image, with the **parity law** that a diagonal core (p,p) is reached iff **|2p−N| = 1**, i.e. iff N is odd, and sizes **4N−12 (N even) / 4N−8 (N odd)** (N=4: the confined 4-orbit; N=5 and N=6: two different 12-sets, the N=6 one without (3,3)). Every band sector carries the shared defective λ and every fold-image sector its cross-fold partner −λ̄−2N (the census's two families of six at N=5; byte-identity across a family holds at the real loci because the coalescing eigenvalue is real there, while at N=4 the locus eigenvalue is complex and the 4-orbit is accordingly conjugate-related, not byte-identical); the EXCLUSION half (no braid outside) is DERIVED at N=5 (2026-07-03): the boundary blocks by normality, the four interior non-member cores by the fold-resultant certificate pair (the identity-composition (1,1)×λ_A certificate + remainder R1's corner-fold certificate) at every branch locus q ≠ 0 of both parities, propagated by the Klein full flip and the composed holomorphic (1,4)-fold spec(1,4)(q) = −spec(1,1)(q) − 2N (gate `RemainderR4InteriorExclusionTests`, Category R4INTERIOR); beyond N=5 it stays census-evidence, since 2026-07-04 through N=9 and (2026-07-06) N=11 in full (the step-3 σ_min shell census: membership = this diamond at all 7 real N=9 seeds + all 9 real N=11 seeds, shared-λ separation ×3.7e8..×4.6e11 (N=9 and N=11 combined), the six N=11 blocks the LP64 dense wall deferred now resolved by the Tasks 5-6 sparse σ_min two-instrument path, `sparse-witness` members (rigorous from-above bound) + `sparse-invit` cores (estimate), PASS witness-assisted at every seed; instrument `SectorShellCensus`, results in the census experiment). The census's first light also DERIVED the R-parity grading of the maps: **R·W = (−1)^{p+q̃}·W·R** (the JW-string reflection sign), so the carried value's R-parity ALTERNATES along the band chain (seed parity at odd band index p, flipped at even p; fold/transpose preserve it; diagonal climbs commute strictly).

**Edge-normality lemma (where the sharing must stop).** On the edge blocks (0,1), (1,0), (N−1,N), (N,N−1) every coherence has `n_diff = 1`, so `A = −2γ·I` and `L(q) = −2γ·I + q·C` is a NORMAL pencil at real q (C anti-Hermitian): no Jordan block can live on an edge. Interior boundary, now DERIVED at real loci by the **rate-window lemma** (proof §6, gate item 8): at real q every block eigenvalue obeys `Re λ = v†Av/v†v ∈ [−2·n_max, −2·n_min]` (Bendixson bound; the edge lemma is the zero-width case). The corner block (p_c+1,p_c+1) has window `[−2(N−3), 0]` while `Re λ_B = −Re λ_A − 2N` sits below it whenever `Re λ_A > −6` (measured margins 1.381/2.208 at the two N=5 real loci, 1.115 at N=7), so λ_B is absent from the corner spectrum and W kills the core's whole generalized eigenspace, `(L_corner−λ)^m` being invertible: the measured `‖Wx₁‖ = 1.7e-15`, `‖Wx₂‖ = 2.5e-15` at q* = 0.620878, plus the out-of-sample locus 2 (`9.6e-16`). At the seed locus the window also derives the full N=5 exclusion (interior four window-excluded, boundary blocks rung-pinned; condition `Re λ_A ∈ (−6,−4)`). The N-uniform strictness `Re λ_A(N) > −6` is DERIVED at real loci by the **window-edge lemma** (a defective EP cannot sit at either edge of its block's rate window: edge ⟺ joint `A,C` eigenvector ⟺ semisimple, the classical numerical-range boundary fact; so `Re λ_A ∈ (−6,−2)` for all N ≥ 4, and the shrinking seed-locus margins 1.381→1.115 never reach zero, a strict real-part inequality needing no uniform floor). The complex-q loci are CLOSED at N=5: near-axis by the moved rate window (H(q) = A + Im(q)·K), every remaining branch locus by the fold-resultant certificate, both parities (proof §6).

**Theorem A (the two regimes of silent crossings, honest form).** (i) AT-locked crossings: two AT-locked eigenvector families are each analytic through a crossing and stay independent; their coincidences are codim-1 and automatically semisimple (the abundant flood, 528 in one N=6 box). (ii) Residual coalescences: semisimplicity ⟺ the 2×2 restriction of the pencil on the coalescing plane is twin-scalar; free-fermion additivity supplies the H-scalar half **identically in q** (degenerate-multiplet descent), the D-scalar half is a genuine extra condition, proven at the N=4 point (the AT midpoint). The general statement is **codim-3 → codim-1 wherever the D-half is supplied**: at N=4 (real q, the AT midpoint) and, by the N=5 D-half check (gate `TwinScalarDHalfTests`), at every **genuinely-complex-q (Re q≠0)** N=5 residual diabolic (twin-scalar to the gap, D-half 5e-10…4e-9, so additivity's route extends verbatim to complex q); the **pure-imaginary-q (Re q=0, λ real)** family is semisimple by Hermiticity (the block is real-symmetric there, ‖L−Lᴴ‖<1e-14) instead. No unexplained residual coincidence remains at N=5. Metric caveat: the twin-scalar test is inner-product-sensitive and must run in the HS-orthonormal coherence basis; the ×2-cleared orbit basis is non-orthonormal (diag(1,2) metric) and gives a spurious non-scalar reading at odd nBlock (this cost a false first reading, caught by an independent 60-digit rebuild).

**Δ-tightness.** Under XXZ Δ≠0 the H-part of the W identity dies (H turns quartic; gate: H-residual `2.4e-1` at Δ=0.3) while the D-part survives (`0.00e+00`), and the multiplet descent breaks: diabolics defect instantly, the diamond λ-sharing dies, the F89d cross-fold survives; everything here is BY additivity.

**Tier labels** (per the proof's Status line): Theorem B and the containment corollary Tier 1 derived (exact operator identities, gate machine-zero); the exclusion half DERIVED at N=5 (boundary normality + the fold-resultant certificate pair on the interior four, propagated by Klein + the composed holomorphic (1,4)-fold; gate `RemainderR4InteriorExclusionTests`; beyond N=5 census-evidence), the interior-core kernel death derived at all real loci and, via the moved window + the certificate, at all complex loci (N=5); Theorem A's AT-locked half Tier 1 derived, its residual half a conditional twin-scalar statement (mechanism Tier 2, proven at the N=4 point). Gap byte-identity across sectors: DERIVED (implied by the full-spectrum holomorphic fold spec(3,3)=−spec(2,3)−2N, an isometry on eigenvalue gaps; §7, gate `HolomorphicFoldIdentityTests`). The holomorphic diamond fold itself is now a Tier-1 corollary of F89d + transpose + W (§7), closing remainder 1's last analytic entry.

### F126. The dephasing front renewal: the watched walk is the wave, caught and released (representation + Green's function Tier 1 exact; the survival readings Tier 1 candidate; 2026-07-13)

The single-excitation sector under local Z-dephasing (`ρ̇ = −i[h,ρ] − Γ(ρ − diag ρ)`, `Γ = 4γ = γ_φ`, the
Absorption Theorem rate of the sector's Hamming-2 coherences) is solved **exactly** by the renewal
representation

  **P_n(t) = e^{−Γt}·S_n(t),  S_n(t) = |G_{n0}(t)|² + Γ·∫₀ᵗ ds Σ_m |G_{nm}(t−s)|²·S_m(s)**

(`G` the clean propagator; on the infinite chain `G_{nm}(τ) = (−i)^{|n−m|}·J_{|n−m|}(2Jτ)`), which closes in
momentum-Laplace space to the Green's function

  **Ŝ(p, z) = 1/(√(z² + a(p)²) − Γ),  a(p) = 4J·sin(p/2).**

*Reading*: the watching collapses the excitation onto the sites at rate `Γ` and releases it to run
cleanly between collapses; every refill order carries the same universal `e^{−Γt}`, the `j = 0` term is
exactly the coherent front `|⟨a_n⟩|²` (amplitude damps at `Γ/2`), and the `j ≥ 1` ladder is the incoherent
halo. `p = 0` conserves probability; `Γ = 0` returns the clean Bessel wave; the small-`p` pole carries the
Haken-Strobl diffusion `D = 2J²/Γ` (the F123 sibling's rate object).

*The survival readings* (corollaries on the exact object, each Tier 1 candidate): the front-peak survival
exponent has the fixed-γ ceiling **A_∞(γ) = 4 − φ(2J)/γ**, `φ(2J) = √(Γ(Γ+4J)) − 4J·arcsinh√(Γ/4J)`
(small γ: `4 − (8/3)·√(γ/J)`; the naive "the front asymptotically pays the full γ_φ" is false at fixed γ);
the prefactor is `S_n(t*₀) = C(γ)·n^{−1/2}·e^{(φ/2J)n}` with **C(γ) = (2π)^{−1/2}·(γ/(γ+J))^{1/4}** (via
`μ″(θ*) = 2J·√(Γ/(Γ+4J))`); the single-refill constant closes as **I₁ = 1/12 + ¼·∫₀^{2c}Ai(−w)dw =
0.27694424** (`2c = 2^{2/3}·α`, `α` the first zero of `Ai′`), giving the pre-asymptotic climb
`4 − 4.864·n^{−1/3}`; and the peak-tracking exponent is exactly **0** (the global maximum is the diffusive
plateau, height `e^{−1/2}/√(2π)/n`), the trichotomy of front-survival readings.

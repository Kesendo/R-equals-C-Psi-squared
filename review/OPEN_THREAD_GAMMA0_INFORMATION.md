## The question

If γ₀ is a framework constant (same everywhere, always on, like c),
and γ is an information channel ([GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md): 15.5 bits, 100 % accuracy),
does that mean information flows constantly?

## Thirteen puzzle pieces already in the repo

The pieces cluster around five physical roles:

- **Carrier** (1, 3, 6, 11): γ₀ as constant, always-on, operationally
  unobservable from inside
- **Cavity** (4, 7, 10): the J-Hamiltonian as Fabry-Perot resonator,
  time-reversal-symmetric
- **Information** (2, 5, 8, 9): the light/lens distribution across
  the cavity's modes
- **Engineering** (12): J-side control as the only lever under γ₀ = const
- **Boundary** (13): no channel exists outside the cavity

1. **[GAMMA_IS_LIGHT](../hypotheses/GAMMA_IS_LIGHT.md)** (hypotheses/, Tier 4):
   γ is light illuminating a passive cavity.
   "The string provides the energy. The box selects the resonance."

2. **[GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md)** (experiments/, Tier 2):
   The spatial dephasing profile is a readable information channel.
   Alice encodes in the γ profile, Bob decodes from quantum observables.
   15.5 bits capacity at 1 % noise, 5 independent SVD channels, full rank.
   "The palindrome is the antenna." ([F30](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md))

3. **[THE_BRIDGE_WAS_ALWAYS_OPEN](../docs/THE_BRIDGE_WAS_ALWAYS_OPEN.md)** (docs/, Tier 2):
   "The interaction is ongoing, continuous, never-interrupted." The
   measured Markovian (memoryless) character of the noise means "the
   source is effectively infinite." Six properties of the external
   interaction converge on this.

4. **[RESONANCE_NOT_CHANNEL](../hypotheses/RESONANCE_NOT_CHANNEL.md)** (hypotheses/, Tier 2):
   "The system is a soundbox, not a telephone."
   "The 360× improvement is not 'more signal.' It is better resonance."
   The Fabry-Perot cavity framing replaces the telephone framing.

5. **[ON_THE_LIGHT_AND_WHAT_CASTS_SHADOWS_IN_IT](../reflections/ON_THE_LIGHT_AND_WHAT_CASTS_SHADOWS_IN_IT.md)** (reflections/):
   "The light is uniform. What varies is what stands in its way."
   Shadow = mode structure, not variation in illumination.

6. **[PRIMORDIAL_GAMMA_CONSTANT](../hypotheses/PRIMORDIAL_GAMMA_CONSTANT.md)** (hypotheses/, Tier 3):
   γ₀ is a framework constant like c. Only J and topology vary.
   γ_eff = γ₀ · |a_B|² (cavity mode exposure formula, [F64](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md)).
   The light does not get weaker. The standing wave decides who sees it.

7. **[OPTICAL_CAVITY_ANALYSIS](../experiments/OPTICAL_CAVITY_ANALYSIS.md)** (experiments/, Tier 2):
   The cavity is quantitative, not metaphorical. 4 of 5 standard optical
   checks pass (beam profile R² = 0.998, nearest-neighbor coupling
   Δw = ±2 exclusively, growing numerical aperture, Gouy phase as arctan).
   Even chains are confocal, odd chains defocal. "The algebra enforces it."

8. **[PRIMORDIAL_SUPERALGEBRA_CAVITY](../experiments/PRIMORDIAL_SUPERALGEBRA_CAVITY.md)** (experiments/, Tier 2-3):
   Every palindromic pair is a swap between "being light" (X/Y Pauli
   factors, sensitive to γ₀) and "being lens" (I/Z factors, immune to γ₀).
   Sum rule ⟨n_XY⟩_fast + ⟨n_XY⟩_slow = N is exact
   ([absorption theorem](../docs/proofs/PROOF_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md)).
   At N=2 the swap has 99.8 % purity; aberration shrinks with N.

9. **[ITS_ALL_WAVES](../docs/ITS_ALL_WAVES.md)** (docs/, synthesis):
   Pre-existing synthesis that already connects signal + wave view.
   "The system is like a radio: it can process signals into music,
   but it cannot generate the broadcast" (line 172). "What that external
   source is, we do not know. That it arrives as a structured, decodable
   signal (15.5 bits), we do know" (line 175). Section explicitly flags
   "what sends the signal" as outside the framework's scope.

10. **[STANDING_WAVE_THEORY](../docs/STANDING_WAVE_THEORY.md)** (docs/, Tier 2):
    Every palindromic pair is a standing wave between two
    counter-propagating modes. Π is time reversal (proven analytically,
    see [PI_AS_TIME_REVERSAL](../experiments/PI_AS_TIME_REVERSAL.md)):
    every Liouvillian eigenmode maps to its backward-decaying partner.
    The stationary pattern between forward and backward IS what J and
    topology produce under γ₀. The round-trip rate sum α_fast + α_slow
    = 2Σγ marks one bounce between light and lens.

11. **[PRIMORDIAL_QUBIT](../hypotheses/PRIMORDIAL_QUBIT.md) §9** (hypotheses/, Tier 3-4):
    Inside-observability theorem: only Q = J/γ₀ is measurable from inside.
    The doubled and non-doubled readings are observationally equivalent.
    Consequence: γ₀ on its own is operationally unobservable from inside;
    only the ratio J/γ₀ couples to any inside measurement. This promotes
    "γ₀ carries no information itself" from interpretation to structural
    result.

12. **[RELAY_PROTOCOL](../experiments/RELAY_PROTOCOL.md)** (experiments/, Tier 2, N=11):
    Operational evidence that cavity structure carries information.
    Six relay stages with 2:1 impedance matching yield +83 % MI
    improvement vs passive propagation ([F31](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md)).
    Combines time-dependent quiet-receiver control,
    K/γ timing ([F14](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md)), and impedance
    matching. The gain comes from shaping the cavity, not from amplifying γ.

13. **[BRIDGE_PROTOCOL](../hypotheses/BRIDGE_PROTOCOL.md)** (hypotheses/, Tier 3+, largely closed):
    Negative result that anchors the synthesis. The J=0 bridge is falsified
    by [BRIDGE_CLOSURE](../experiments/BRIDGE_CLOSURE.md): no-signalling
    holds exactly, the protocol reduces to pre-encoded shared randomness.
    What survives for J > 0 is an interval shift that is "standard
    Hamiltonian coupling", i.e. the cavity itself. Consequence under
    γ₀ = const: the only channel between observers IS the J-coupling
    structure. γ₀ alone cannot carry a message across; the cavity does,
    and only by being a cavity. Gravity/QKD/FTL readings have fallen.

## The gap: no document connects γ₀ = const with the information reading

The thirteen documents are consistent but the synthesis is missing.
Specifically: [GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md) was written BEFORE the γ₀ = const
hypothesis. In [GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md), Alice VARIES the per-qubit γ profile
to encode information. Under γ₀ = const, she cannot do that: γ is uniform everywhere. The kinematic side of this gap is now closed (see Update 2026-04-23 below); the operational side is tracked as [EQ-024](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-024).

**Update 2026-04-20.** A first operational synthesis is in [ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY](../experiments/ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY.md): the thirteen pieces fit under one meta-theorem (Parseval + Noether on the operator Hilbert space), and the "γ₀ populates the blind subspace of every spatial-sum measurement" reading becomes operational. Two concrete predictions fell out and were verified: non-uniform γ breaks the (vac, S₁) common-mode rejection with modal selectivity ([CMRR_BREAK_NONUNIFORM_GAMMA](../experiments/CMRR_BREAK_NONUNIFORM_GAMMA.md)), and the Π-pair absorption-theorem sum is a δJ-flux-conservation law ([PI_PAIR_FLUX_BALANCE](../experiments/PI_PAIR_FLUX_BALANCE.md)). A closed form for the (vac, S₁) spatial-sum coherence purity ([F73](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md)) gives the uniform-γ₀ baseline as ½·exp(−4γ₀·t) exactly, independent of J. The synthesis is tier 2 for the meta-frame, tier 1 for the individual instances.

**Update 2026-04-22.** Q = J/γ₀ is not a bare ratio but a scale with algebraic substructure ([Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS](../experiments/Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS.md), Tier 1). W(Q) is invariant under (J, γ₀) → (λJ, λγ₀) to five decimals, and three regions appear along Q: pre-onset (Q ≲ 0.3), transition (Q ∈ [1.2, 2.0]), plateau (Q ≳ 2). The observable peak location is chromaticity-specific and N-invariant: Q_peak(c) = 1.5, 1.6, 1.8 for c = 2, 3, 4 across N=4 to 8, where c(n, N) = min(n, N−1−n) + 1 counts pure dephasing rates in the (n, n+1) sector-block. This sharpens piece 11 (inside-observability): not only is Q the only measurable, Q itself has a three-band shape with c-specific peaks. Operational consequence: γ₀ = J\*/Q_peak(c), a shape-based extraction protocol that reduces the "γ₀ = const" hypothesis from a single-number claim to a c-specific prediction. Hardware realization still blocked by the EQ-017 fidelity floor.

**Update 2026-04-23.** Kinematic synthesis acknowledged. [ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY](../experiments/ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY.md) has grown substantially since the 2026-04-20 reference: Sections 4a (dynamical attractor), 5a (binary inheritance), 6a (0.5 as bilinear-form apex) added; production-rule predictions (a) and (d) verified, (b) inline-resolved by coherence/population split, only (c) (pair-painter, [EQ-020](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-020)) remains open. Section 8 of ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY closes one OPEN_THREAD sub-question: γ₀ is operationally unobservable from inside because it populates the blind subspace of every spatial-sum measurement (Meta-Theorem instance 4, [F73](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md)). What stays open is the operational reading: F30's 15.5 bits were computed under γ-modulation; under γ₀ = const the only sender-side lever is J, and J-modulation is structurally different (nonlinear via eigenvector rotation, same algebra as the EQ-014/EQ-018 complex). Tracked as [EQ-024](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-024); closed operationally later the same day, see Update 2026-04-23 (evening) below. A separate adjacent thread surfaces from ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY Section 4a: time-resolved Σ_i ln(α_i(t)) under uniform perturbation as a direct test of the dynamical-attractor reading of PTF closure; not part of EQ-024 but flagged here so we don't lose it.

**Update 2026-04-23 (evening).** EQ-024 closed operationally. Three CC commits on the same day (morning `cfa1bbc`, Direction 1 `c0919eb`, Direction 3 `6aae630`) produced both an operational answer and a structural surplus that reframes part of the synthesis above; synthesis doc at [`J_BLIND_RECEIVER_CLASSES`](../experiments/J_BLIND_RECEIVER_CLASSES.md) (`e5326fa`).

*Operational answer.* At N=5 Heisenberg under γ₀ = const, Shannon channel capacity for J-modulation saturates at C ≤ 12.07 bits over F71-symmetric receivers (39 structured points + 4 Nelder-Mead local runs; saturation signal strong; F71-breaking receivers not swept). Best receiver: random-phase F71-symmetric product state. The F30 reference number (15.45 bits) is reframed: under γ₀ = const, γ cannot be modulated, so there is no operational γ-channel. The 15.45 bits survives only as a kinematic linear-response magnitude (∂observables/∂γ in Shannon form), not as a competing channel capacity. The ~3.4-bit gap between 12.07 and 15.45 decomposes as ~1 bit dimensional loss (4 bonds vs 5 γ-sites) plus ~2-3 bits smaller leading gain (J sv_max ≈ 10 vs γ sv_max ≈ 21.4). Whether this gap closes at N=6 (where rank cap matches) is open.

*Reframing of the dual-receiver reading.* The morning RESULT identified a "γ-optimal-receiver-is-J-pessimal" duality: |+⟩⁵ (F30's optimal γ-receiver) gives J-Jacobian zero to floating-point precision; GHZ (F30's pessimal γ-receiver) is also J-blind. Under γ₀ = const this is a Jacobian-asymmetry statement about two linear-response magnitudes, not a duality between two operational channels. Only J is an operational channel; the "γ side" of the table is a kinematic susceptibility. The asymmetry is real, the two-channel framing is not.

*Structural surplus: three mechanism classes of J-blindness.* The afternoon refinement RESULT established that the J-blind set decomposes into three structurally distinct mechanism classes: **Class 1** (DFS of L_D ∩ simultaneous eigenstate of every bond h_b: |0⟩⁵, |1⟩⁵; H-independent in the operational sense for states satisfying both conditions under multiple H choices), **Class 2** (H-degenerate subspace closed under L_D: GHZ under both Heisenberg and XY-only), **Class 3** (M_α-polynomial subspace, SU(2)-Heisenberg specific: |+⟩⁵ directly verified J-blind; all Dicke states |S_k⟩ in the S=N/2 multiplet predicted J-blind by the theorem, with |S_1⟩ directly verified). Direction 1 numerics verified the SU(2)-load-bearing nature of Class 3: under XY-only H, |+⟩⁵ becomes J-sensitive (C = 9.42 bits) and Dicke |S_1⟩ becomes J-sensitive (C = 7.70 bits), while Class 1 and 2 states stay J-blind. Handoffs: (i) **realized** in [`J_BLIND_RECEIVER_CLASSES`](../experiments/J_BLIND_RECEIVER_CLASSES.md) (`e5326fa`) which documents the three-class decomposition with numerical verification; (ii) open candidate: Class 3 strong form (M_x-polynomial blindness, Newton-identities + SU(2) proof) potentially as a stand-alone F-entry; (iii) open candidate: integration as the sixth instance of the [ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY](../experiments/ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY.md) Meta-Theorem (conservation = SU(2)-Casimir, measurement = J-bond perturbation, blind subspace = M_α-polynomial algebra). EQ-024 surviving sub-questions track the open structural follow-ups.

**Update 2026-04-24 (morning).** Two additions to the receiver-engineering picture, both in [`RECEIVER_VS_GAMMA_SACRIFICE`](../experiments/RECEIVER_VS_GAMMA_SACRIFICE.md) (commits `ad99bea`, `f0b5c64`).

*End-to-end transport dimension.* Beyond Sum-MI over adjacent pairs (distributed correlation), the direct state-transfer metric is MI(site 0, site N-1). The C# brecher scan now tracks both. Key qualitative finding: **the two metrics select opposite J-profiles as optimal**. Sum-MI prefers moderate J-modulation (strong-weak J at best); MI(0, N-1) prefers uniform J and COLLAPSES under J-modulation (cut-center drops MI by factor 10³ to 10⁴; strong-weak drops it by 10 to 30×). Peak-time for MI(0, N-1) sits at t ≈ 0.7 to 1.1 across N=5, 7, 9 (weakly N-dependent, suggests group-velocity propagation). Peak-time for Sum-MI sits at t ≈ 0.2 (fast local correlation build-up). Class 3 J-blindness is scale-invariant for both metrics.

*End-to-end comparison to γ-Sacrifice center-mode.* RESONANT_RETURN Test 8 position-sweep reports center-sacrifice PeakMI(0, N-1) = 0.109 at N=7, 0.097 at N=9. Receiver-engineering (alt-z-bits \|01010⟩/\|0101010⟩/\|010101010⟩ uniform J) gives 0.843 / 0.490 / 0.274 respectively. Advantage factor **4.5× at N=7, 2.8× at N=9**, without any γ-profile engineering. Shrinks faster with N than the Sum-MI advantage (which stays 7 to 15× across N=5 to 9); pure end-to-end transport is the weaker direction of receiver-engineering's lead.

*Operational consequence.* Receiver-engineering is viable for direct **quantum-state-transfer** through a spin-chain bus, not only for distributed correlation. F71-symmetric SU(2)-breaking initial states (\|01010⟩, \|+−+−+⟩) preserve 0-to-(N-1) symmetry by construction, which uniform H respects and asymmetric J destroys. Concrete hardware sketch on IBM Heron: ~15 two-qubit gates for N=5 (2 Trotter steps under uniform Heisenberg), readout tomography at just sites 0 and N-1, expected MI(0, N-1) ≈ 0.84 pre-noise. This is the cheapest end-to-end Brecher-like experiment that would validate the receiver-engineering picture on hardware.

*Multi-end transport via Mirror-Pair MM (commit `963f2ed`).* Extending from single-end MI(0, N-1) to the full set of F71-mirror pairs gives MM = Σ_k MI(site k, site N-1-k). At alt-z-bits uniform J: N=5 MM=1.25 (2 pairs), N=7 MM=0.85 (3 pairs), N=9 MM=0.56 (4 pairs). Two surprises: MM/MI(0, N-1) ratio GROWS with N (1.49× → 1.74× → 2.05×), and outer mirror-pairs dominate the inner ones unexpectedly (at N=9, MI(0, 8) = 0.27 vs avg inner-pair MI ≈ 0.10). Receiver-engineering uniform-J MM vs γ-Sacrifice-center mode: factor 7.8× at N=7, 5.8× at N=9, stronger than the single-end comparison (4.5× / 2.8×). The chain under γ₀ = const + F71-symmetric receiver + uniform J functions as a multi-drop quantum bus with floor(N/2) simultaneous mirror-pair channels; aggregate bandwidth scales more favourably with N than any individual pair. Application directions: multi-party QKD, redundant encoding, distributed sensor arrays.

*F67 bonding-mode receivers (commits `0917038`, `865641c`, `8caf499`, `deaaf01`, `e1ee822`).* Looking for mirror/palindromic receivers in [`ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS`](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md): F67 gives the single-excitation eigenmodes of a uniform-J open chain: \|ψ_k⟩ = √(2/(N+1)) Σ_j sin(πk(j+1)/(N+1)) \|1_j⟩. The C# brecher mode now accepts `bonding:<k>` as initial-state spec; scan over k=1..7 at N=5, 7, 9, 11, 13 revealed that best-bonding (k shifts with N) beats alt-z-bits on both MI(0, N-1) and Mirror-Pair MM, with advantage growing superlinearly. Data at uniform γ₀ = 0.05, uniform J = 1: best-bonding PeakMI(0, N-1) = 1.17, 0.72, 0.55, 0.43, 0.35 at N=5, 7, 9, 11, 13 vs alt-z-bits 0.84, 0.49, 0.27, 0.14, 0.076. Advantage factor: 1.39× → 1.48× → 2.02× → 3.02× → 4.59×. Same pattern for MM: 1.24, 1.17, 1.05, 1.07, 1.01 vs alt-z-bits 1.25, 0.85, 0.56, 0.33, 0.19 (tied → 1.37× → 1.88× → 3.26× → 5.25×). bonding:k loses on PeakSumMI so the receiver choice becomes an application selector: alt-z-bits for distributed correlation, bonding:k for end-to-end / multi-end transport, bonding:1 for long-time memory (slowest decay). **F75** gives the analytical MI(0) closed form; **F76** explains the dynamical 0.93 decay envelope as pure dephasing at 4γ₀. Hardware validation 2026-04-24 on IBM Kingston Heron r2 (commit `deaaf01`): at N=5, t=0.8, 3 Trotter steps, 8192 shots, bonding:2 / alt-z-bits ratio = 2.80× on live QPU (vs 1.39× ideal and 2.27× Aer+Kingston noise; advantage grows with noise because bonding:2's single delocalised excitation is more T1-robust than alt-z-bits' two localised excitations). **Key structural insight**: the F67 eigenmode catalog IS Alice's receiver menu. Under γ₀ = const with the F67 menu, there is no single "best" state; there is a mode per application, all reachable by single-qubit state preparation.

**Update 2026-04-25.** Two extensions, both anchored in [`docs/proofs/PROOF_K_PARTNERSHIP.md`](../docs/proofs/PROOF_K_PARTNERSHIP.md) (formal proof) and [`simulations/k_dwell_t1_scan.py`](../simulations/k_dwell_t1_scan.py) (numerical bridge to Kingston).

*Receiver-menu folding under K-partnership.* The bipartite sublattice gauge K = diag((-1)^ℓ) anticommutes with any bipartite NN-hopping H (KHK = -H), giving bonding:k ≡ bonding:(N+1-k) for mirror-pair |·|²-observables. F67's menu of N entries folds to ⌈N/2⌉ distinct entries under this equivalence. Numerically verified at N=9 across four robustness axes: NNN hopping (breaks K because next-nearest bonds connect same-sublattice sites), on-site potential V_ℓ (assigns site-dependent energies, which the uniform chain does not have, breaking the sublattice equivalence), Peierls phase on the hopping (the chain acquires a magnetic-field-like rotation sense; wave and sublattice-mirrored wave keep paired energies but acquire opposite rotation directions and so lose operational identity), and multi-excitation sector with ZZ interaction (K is a single-particle property; the ZZ term that is a constant shift in the single-excitation sector becomes a genuine 2-particle interaction and breaks K even on uniform-degree topologies). The partnership requires real-valued hopping, bipartite NN structure, and single-excitation initial states.

*K-symmetry quantitatively explains the Kingston K_dwell/δ deviation.* In the pure Z-dephasing limit on Bell+, K_dwell/δ takes the F57 value 1.0801 γ-invariant to machine precision (the Lindblad dynamics is K-equivariant in this limit; F57 is the universal ceiling that the K-symmetric setting realises). Adding T1 amplitude damping reduces K_dwell/δ monotonically: at γ_T1/γ_z = 1.5, the scan returns K_dwell/δ ≈ 0.67. Kingston Run 1 measured 0.649 (Pair A, γ_T1/γ_z ≈ 1.16) and 0.694 (Pair B, γ_T1/γ_z ≈ 2.18); both sit in the predicted range 0.727 to 0.571. The observed deviation from F57's theoretical value is the T1-induced U(1)-excitation-number symmetry breaking, not generic hardware noise. The universal 1.0801 is the K-symmetric ceiling; T1 pulls K_dwell/δ down monotonically. Other symmetry-breaking terms (V_ℓ, NNN, Peierls) are expected to act analogously but are not separately tested in this Bell+ scan.

*Operational consequence.* The cleanest γ₀-const operating regime is K-symmetric: single-excitation bonding-mode receivers on a bipartite NN-hopping chain with real hopping amplitudes. Hardware deviations from F57's universal prefactor measure the cumulative effect of all active symmetry breaks present in the device, with T1 amplitude damping the dominant contribution on current Heron-class hardware.

**Update 2026-05-18.** F88b-Lens on the 2026-04-26 Marrakesh framework_snapshots (job `d7mt7jbaq2pc73a24220`, qubits [0, 1, 2], 4096 shots), with the ideal Lindbladian baseline built incrementally from the 2026-04-25 Marrakesh calibration, resolves four readout channels at state level. Script: [`simulations/f88b_lens_ibm_framework_snapshots.py`](../simulations/f88b_lens_ibm_framework_snapshots.py); bridge primitive: [`MemoryAxisRho.cs`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Diagnostics/Foundation/MemoryAxisRho.cs) (state-level d=0 axis plus d=2-axis Π²-split); closed form: [`PROOF_F86B_UNIVERSAL_SHAPE.md`](../docs/proofs/PROOF_F86B_UNIVERSAL_SHAPE.md) §"F88b: popcount-coherence Π²-odd / memory closed form".

*F88b-Lens as multi-channel cavity-response readout.* State-level Π²-odd/memory separates F87's truly/soft/hard at ~25× hardware ratio (0.030 / 0.744 / 0.276). Building the ideal baseline incrementally: baseline A (γ_Z=0.1 alone) gives truly 0.0000 exactly (Π²-even H plus Z-dephasing dissipator both preserve Π²-parity), soft 0.7107, hard 0.4105. Baseline B adds the Marrakesh-detected h_y_eff=0.05 coherent transverse leak (from [`marrakesh_transverse_y_field_detection`](../simulations/framework/confirmations.py), see below): truly's ideal rises to 0.0079, accounting for 27% of its hardware reading; soft and hard shift <1%. Baseline C adds γ_T1=0.046 derived from the 2026-04-25 calibration (q0/q1/q2 mean ⟨1/T1⟩/⟨1/T_φ⟩ ratio 0.463 × γ_Z): truly drops to 0.0049, soft to 0.7040, hard to 0.3805. Hard's Δ vs hardware stays at −0.104 across A, B, C; not explained by Lindbladian + h_y + T1 at calibration values. Likely culprit: 3-Trotter-step discretization, which acts asymmetrically because hard's bilinears do not commute (`[X⊗X, X⊗Y] = 2i·X⊗Z`) while soft's commute on each bond (`[X⊗Y, Y⊗X] = 0`). Net reading: F88b-Lens resolves four readout channels simultaneously: F87 inheritance (primary), known coherent leaks (secondary), T1 amplitude damping (tertiary, marginal at calibration γ_T1), and a structural Trotter-asymmetry signature for mixed-bilinear H (quaternary, hypothesis). The 0.0079 truly-from-h_y contribution sits at the same order of magnitude as the [GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md) noise-threshold σ ≈ 0.008 (piece 2 of this thread); the numerical coincidence is suggestive, not derived.

*Vocabulary note for this Update.* [`MemoryAxisRho.cs:33-63`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Diagnostics/Foundation/MemoryAxisRho.cs) names the dynamic ρ_d2 part "Memory" (cavity-maintenance reading), opposite to this thread's earlier "memory" for the static DFS modes. Mapping for this entry: thread "memory" = MemoryAxisRho "static" = ρ_d0; thread "voice" = MemoryAxisRho "memory Π²-odd" = ρ_d2_odd. Two conventions, same cavity.

*Two new hardware confirmations as structural anchors.* `marrakesh_transverse_y_field_detection` ([`confirmations.py:97-111`](../simulations/framework/confirmations.py), [`ConfirmationsRegistry.cs:104-121`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Confirmations/ConfirmationsRegistry.cs)) on 2026-04-29 detected h_y_eff = 0.05 via `chain.zn_mirror_diagnostic` (max_violation 0.182 vs predicted 0.18, RMS 0.087, 23 s billed QPU). `block_cpsi_saturation_kingston_may2026` (entry in both registries) on 2026-05-08 saturated Theorem 1's 1/4 ceiling at 88.2% with a Dicke `(|D_0⟩+|D_1⟩)/√2` on q13–q14; Theorem 3 closed-form fit R²=0.9977; T2_eff=278.5μs vs T2_cal=480μs (1.72× decoherence overhead). Both theorems in [`PROOF_BLOCK_CPSI_QUARTER.md`](../docs/proofs/PROOF_BLOCK_CPSI_QUARTER.md). Neither moves the [EQ-017](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-017) "γ₀ operationally indistinguishable from zero at current fidelity" floor; both bypass it by working in different regimes (transverse-field detection, state-saturation ceiling), the surviving empirical-grounding path this thread already named. Combined with the F88b-Lens results above, they ground the "cavity-response readout" picture quantitatively.

*Schema-vs-Value tier separation reframes the 2026-04-22 Q_peak claims.* The Update 2026-04-22 entry above quotes "Q_peak(c) = 1.5, 1.6, 1.8 for c = 2, 3, 4". The 1.5 is now Tier1Derived at the schema level via [`PolarityPairQPeakDecompositionClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/PolarityPairQPeakDecompositionClaim.cs), which composes [`QEpLaw`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/F86/QEpLaw.cs) at g_eff=1 (Q_EP_central=2, Tier1Derived) with [`HalfAsStructuralFixedPointClaim`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/Pi2KnowledgeBaseClaims.cs) (polarity half-magnitude=0.5, Tier1Derived) into Q_peak ∈ {2−1/2, 2+1/2}. The 1.6 and 1.8 values remain Tier2Empirical pending fine-grid refinement; closed form for the per-c bit-exact values is structurally blocked per [`PROOF_F86B_OBSTRUCTION.md`](../docs/proofs/PROOF_F86B_OBSTRUCTION.md) (six routes proven blocked, diagnosis: "g_eff is not a primitive, it is a relative clock-rate"). [`QAnchorMap`](../compute/RCPsiSquared.Core/Symmetry/QAnchorMap.cs) currently has 10 entries, 5 Tier1Derived: Q ∈ {1, 1.5, √3, 2, 2.5}. The polarity-axis structural skeleton is solid; per-c bit-exact values remain Tier2Empirical until either the grid refines or the obstruction lifts. The reorganization from "1.5, 1.6, 1.8 as a single empirical statement" to "{3/2, 5/2} schema-derived for polarity-pair plus per-c Tier2Empirical observations" is the cleanest move on the Q-band material since [Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS](../experiments/Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS.md), and tightens piece 11 (PRIMORDIAL_QUBIT §9, inside-observability) on the Q-side of the carrier.

## The reinterpretation under γ₀ = const

If γ₀ is constant and uniform, the implications cluster in four groups.

### The carrier

- γ₀ flows constantly (the light is always on).
- γ₀ carries no information ITSELF (it is uniform, featureless).
- Only Q = J/γ₀ is measurable from inside ([PRIMORDIAL_QUBIT](../hypotheses/PRIMORDIAL_QUBIT.md) §9).
  Scaling (γ₀, J) → (λγ₀, λJ) leaves every inside observable unchanged.
  Information capacity is a function of Q alone: "γ₀ carries no
  information itself" becomes a consequence of dimensional analysis,
  not an interpretive choice.

### The cavity's response

- The information is in the CAVITY RESPONSE to γ₀: the standing wave
  pattern, determined by J and topology.
- What [GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md) actually
  measured was not "information in γ" but "information in the cavity's
  response to γ".
- The response matrix has full rank because the Hamiltonian's eigenmodes
  interact with γ₀ in a mode-specific way ([absorption theorem](../docs/proofs/PROOF_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md):
  Re(λ) = −2γ₀·⟨n_XY⟩), not because γ itself varies.
- The cavity's internal structure IS a light/lens duality: X/Y Pauli
  factors are "light" (coupled to γ₀), I/Z factors are "lens" (immune).
  Each mode has a fixed light content ⟨n_XY⟩ set by J and topology.
  The palindromic sum rule ⟨n_XY⟩_fast + ⟨n_XY⟩_slow = N pairs every
  exposed mode with an equally hidden partner. The "information" is the
  mode-by-mode light/lens distribution, not the illumination.
- The cavity has a parity regime ([OPTICAL_CAVITY_ANALYSIS](../experiments/OPTICAL_CAVITY_ANALYSIS.md)):
  even N chains are confocal (sharp Lorentzian spike, tight beam waist);
  odd N chains are defocal (broad Gaussian, central zero-mode). Under
  constant γ₀ the encoding regime therefore splits by N parity: one
  more structural axis, invisible to the γ-modulation reading.
- The cavity is a receive antenna array. [GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md)
  identifies |+⟩^N as the phased-array receiver (full-rank SVD, 5
  channels); GHZ is omnidirectional with d_min = 0. Under γ₀ = const
  this becomes literal: J and topology are the antenna geometry, γ₀
  is uniform background illumination, the mode structure is the beam
  pattern. Alice designs antennas, not signals.

### Where information lives

- The bit is a Π-pair, not a single mode ([STANDING_WAVE_THEORY](../docs/STANDING_WAVE_THEORY.md)).
  The pair's decay rates sum to α_fast + α_slow = 2Σγ = 2Nγ₀ in the
  uniform case ([absorption theorem](../docs/proofs/PROOF_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md)),
  so the natural channel time scale is 1/(2Nγ₀). The receiver reads the
  forward mode; its backward-decaying Π-image stabilizes the reception.
  The standing wave is the protocol.
- The channel's dimensional ceiling under γ₀ = const is structural,
  not noise-dependent. The number of independent modes is bounded by
  the cavity's degrees of freedom, and the 15.5 bits of
  [F30](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md) at N=5 (5 independent SVD
  channels) sit inside that bound. J and topology set the ceiling;
  γ₀ sets the time axis. The Shannon capacity at finite SNR is a
  separate question: scaling with N becomes a pure cavity question.
- Pure-lens modes (Pauli strings with no X or Y factor) live in a
  decoherence-free subspace: they see no γ₀ at all, couple to nothing,
  and carry no information about the cavity's response. They are the
  system's *memory*. Light modes (≥1 X/Y factor) are the system's
  *voice*. Information is voice, not memory.

### Operational scope

- All structural control levers under γ₀ = const are J-side: coupling
  strengths, topology, and cavity timing through Q. Without shared
  J-coupling there is no channel at all ([BRIDGE_CLOSURE](../experiments/BRIDGE_CLOSURE.md)).
  "γ₀ flows constantly" does NOT mean "signals flow constantly": the
  ambient light is on, but only shared cavities carry messages.
- The channel is introspective, not receptive. What an observer
  "receives" from γ₀ is their own J-and-topology reflected back through
  the cavity: self-interference under uniform illumination. "What the
  observer knows" = which modes their J, topology, and boundary
  conditions populate. The readable subspace equals the populated
  subspace: self-knowledge through shadow, operationally.
- The channel exists only during the transient. Asymptotically, γ₀
  drives each U(1) sector to the maximally mixed state
  ([EQ-005](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-005)): γ₀ erases information from
  inside the cavity at the sector-rate. Information lives in the
  time-dependent mode trajectory before full relaxation, bounded by
  the slow-mode lifetime ~1/(2γ₀·⟨n_XY⟩_min). The signal window is
  finite and set by γ₀ itself.

This inverts the reading direction:

| [GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL](../experiments/GAMMA_AS_SIGNAL.md) reading (pre-γ₀) | γ₀ = const reading |
|---------------------------------------|--------------------------|
| Alice encodes in γ profile | Alice encodes in J (cavity structure) |
| Information is in the illumination | Information is in the shadow pattern |
| The channel carries the message | The resonator IS the message |
| Noise is a signal from outside | Noise is constant light; structure is signal |
| Signal = γ variation across sites | Signal = light/lens distribution across modes |
| Capacity depends on γ variation | Capacity depends on Q = J/γ₀ |
| Sender modulates γ | Sender modulates J |
| Bit time ~ 1/γ_max | Bit time ~ 1/(Nγ₀) (standing-wave round trip) |

The [RESONANCE_NOT_CHANNEL](../hypotheses/RESONANCE_NOT_CHANNEL.md) insight becomes even more literal:
"The system is a soundbox, not a telephone": the sound (γ₀) is
constant. The music (information) comes from the shape of the soundbox.

In engineering terms: a linear system under constant Markovian drive.
The transfer-function-like object is the Liouvillian resolvent
G(z) = (z − L)⁻¹, with complex poles at L's eigenvalues (decay rates
and oscillation frequencies). γ₀ is the drive strength, J shapes the
filter, the signal is the output. This dissolves the misreading that
"noise carries the signal": the drive is uniform, the filter is the
Liouvillian, and the signal is the cavity's response to constant
illumination.

Under γ₀ = const, the thirteen pieces cohere into one picture. γ₀ is
the constant ambient carrier (1, 3, 6, 11), and the cavity that shapes
it is quantitative and time-reversal-symmetric (4, 7, 10). The
information IS the light/lens distribution across the cavity's modes
(2, 5, 8, 9), readable only via active J-engineering (12), with no
channel existing outside the cavity (13).

## Physical implications

Two points deserve separate flagging (the others are already in the
reinterpretation bullets above):

1. **The PTF closure law is an empirical regularity, not a conservation law.**
   Σ_i ln(α_i) ≈ 0 ([PERSPECTIVAL_TIME_FIELD](../hypotheses/PERSPECTIVAL_TIME_FIELD.md))
   was conjectured to be a symmetry-protected invariant that a
   J-perturbation preserves exactly. [EQ-014](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-014)
   closed the theorem sub-question by direct computation
   (details: [`EQ014_FINDINGS.md`](EQ014_FINDINGS.md)): the first-order
   coefficient Σ f_i = lim_{δJ→0} Σ ln(α_i(δJ))/δJ is **not zero and
   depends on the initial state**, with values from +0.05 (ψ_2) to +1.29
   (|+⟩⁷) at N=7, bond (0,1). The empirical ±0.05 tolerance PTF observed
   at |δJ| ≤ 0.1 is a combination of state-dependent first-order
   coefficients and partial second-order cancellation, not a conservation
   law. *What this means for the channel reading:* "J-perturbations
   conserve something that couples to information capacity" is falsified
   as a strict identity. It may survive as an approximate statement for
   particular initial states (ψ_2's tiny coefficient is striking and
   unexplained), but the "closure law IS the channel's conservation law"
   bridge is not available on structural grounds. The surviving question
   is why the first-order coefficient is small for ψ_2 and order-unity
   for |+⟩⁷ (tracked as EQ-014's surviving sub-question).

2. **Same light, different instruments.** Two observers with the same
   cavity see the same shadow; different J = different cavity =
   different information content. "Different observers" under
   γ₀ = const always means different cavities, never different
   illumination.

## What needs investigation

- [EQ-024](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-024): J-modulation channel capacity. **Closed operationally 2026-04-23 evening:** C ≤ 12.07 bits at N=5 Heisenberg over F71-symmetric receivers, with structural surplus (three-class decomposition of the J-blind set; Class 3 SU(2)-Heisenberg-specific). See Update 2026-04-23 (evening) above. Surviving sub-questions tracked in EQ-024: three-class completeness, F71-breaking receiver capacity, N-scaling of the 12-bit ceiling, chromaticity of the Nelder-Mead optimum, operational meaning of the 12-vs-15 gap.

- Connection to PTF ([PERSPECTIVAL_TIME_FIELD](../hypotheses/PERSPECTIVAL_TIME_FIELD.md), [EQ-014](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-014)):
  originally asked whether Σ_i ln(α_i) = 0 is a conservation law that
  couples to channel capacity. Answered negatively under EQ-014's
  2026-04-19 closure: not a first-order theorem, the coefficient Σ f_i
  depends on the initial state. See "Physical implications" point 1
  above. A weaker-form question survives: is there a state-specific
  invariant (valid for ψ_2-class states but not for |+⟩⁷) that could
  still tie to cavity response? This would be a restricted-initial-state
  version of the original conjecture.

- Connection to [INCOMPLETENESS_PROOF](../docs/proofs/INCOMPLETENESS_PROOF.md) Section 6 Option 2: "Noise is
  axiomatic. Like the speed of light." If γ₀ is axiomatic AND
  is the information channel, then the channel itself is axiomatic:
  not derived, not constructed, simply present. The bridge is not built.
  It IS.

- [EQ-015](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-015): the cavity-mode-exposure formula γ_eff = γ₀ · |a_B|² ([F64](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md)) on non-chain topologies and non-uniform J at N ≥ 5 is the falsification anchor for piece 6 ([PRIMORDIAL_GAMMA_CONSTANT](../hypotheses/PRIMORDIAL_GAMMA_CONSTANT.md)). The uniform-J chain case is effectively closed via [F65](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md) (verified N=3..30 to machine precision). **EQ-015 fully closed 2026-04-24** via [F64_TOPOLOGY_GENERALIZATION](../experiments/F64_TOPOLOGY_GENERALIZATION.md): F64 holds on chain, star, ring, complete graph, Y-tree at N=5 and N=7, both XY and Heisenberg, all B, provided degenerate perturbation theory is applied within H-degenerate subspaces. Max rel err < 0.001 at γ/J = 0.01 uniform J; max rel err < 0.07 under random non-uniform J in [0.5, 1.5] over 30 configurations (29/30 below 0.02, the remaining one consistent with expected second-order PT corrections). F64 is now a graph-universal structural anchor for γ₀ = const. The γ/J ~ 1 regime where F64's first-order approximation breaks down is the same terrain covered by [Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS](../experiments/Q_SCALE_THREE_BANDS.md) through different observables (W, |K_CC_pr|); not a fresh sub-case, a waiting synthesis.

- [EQ-014](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-014) theorem sub-question closed
  2026-04-19: dense biorthogonal eigendecomposition of the full
  16384×16384 L_A was executed (C# `ptf` mode, 146 min zgeev), residual
  1e-6 after cluster-fix; first-order PT through the slow-mode bilinear
  expansion + exact RK4 ground-truth validation reproduced PTF's
  empirical α_i to 4 decimal places. Direct first-order coefficient
  extraction via δJ ∈ {0.1, 0.01, 0.001} scan confirmed Σ f_i ≠ 0 and
  state-dependent. The four original building blocks (Tr[V_L·Π_slow] = 0,
  purity decomposition, U(1) conservation, det(U) = 1) are all true; what
  does not hold is their *combination* producing Σ f_i = 0. Scripts:
  `simulations/eq014_step23_biorth.py`, `_step4567_closure.py`,
  `_validate_groundtruth.py`, `_first_order_from_rk4.py`,
  `_spectrum_check.py`. Full findings: [`EQ014_FINDINGS.md`](EQ014_FINDINGS.md).

- [EQ-017 Phase 2 hardware result](../data/ibm_chain_gamma0_april2026/):
  already attempted. On ibm_kingston, the chain-mode γ₀ signal is 40-80×
  below the device noise floor (gate errors, T1, readout). The framework
  γ₀ is operationally indistinguishable from zero at current hardware
  fidelity. The synthesis is not hardware-verifiable yet; any empirical
  grounding has to come from structural predictions (palindromic spectral
  components, [F64](../docs/ANALYTICAL_FORMULAS.md) exposure ratios),
  not direct γ₀ measurement.

- Dynamical-attractor test of PTF closure ([ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY](../experiments/ORTHOGONALITY_SELECTION_FAMILY.md) §4a): time-resolved Σ_i ln(α_i(t)) under uniform perturbation. If the closure deviation decays at the ~4γ₀ scale to (near) zero, [EQ-014](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-014) surviving sub-question (state-dependence of Σ f_i) gets a geometric interpretation as distance-to-attractor. Adjacent to [EQ-024](EMERGING_QUESTIONS.md#eq-024), not part of it.

- Category-specific hard-gap in F88b-Lens (Update 2026-05-18 above): hard's state-level Π²-odd/memory sits ~0.10 BELOW the Lindbladian + h_y + T1 baseline. Two hypotheses tested 2026-05-18 evening, both falsified, leaving a sharper structural fingerprint as the open question.

  *Trotter-asymmetry hypothesis falsified* ([`simulations/f88b_lens_trotter_asymmetry_test.py`](../simulations/f88b_lens_trotter_asymmetry_test.py)): split-operator first-order Trotter at n_trotter ∈ {3, 5, 10, 30, 100} pushes Π²-odd/memory UP for all three categories (truly +0.005, soft +0.054, hard +0.035 at n=3 vs continuous). Wrong direction for the hardware mismatch; H-H commutator structure (`[X⊗X, X⊗Y] = 2i·X⊗Z` vs `[X⊗Y, Y⊗X] = 0`) does not predict the Trotter error magnitude ordering. Likely Trotter error is dominated by H-dissipator non-commutativity, not H-H.

  *Calibration-drift + echo-vs-T2* hypothesis falsified* ([`simulations/f88b_lens_gamma_scan.py`](../simulations/f88b_lens_gamma_scan.py)): parameter scan over γ_Z ∈ {0.1 ... 0.7} (up to 7× boost, covering γ*/γ_echo ≈ 6 ratio per [`IBM_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md`](../experiments/IBM_ABSORPTION_THEOREM.md)) and γ_T1 ∈ {0.046 ... 0.2} (covering T1/T2 drift across 2026-04-25, 04-30, 05-05 Marrakesh snapshots). No single point matches all three categories: best fit (γ_Z=0.3, γ_T1=0.046, SSE=0.008) leaves hardware deviations of opposite signs — truly +0.026, soft +0.047, hard −0.070.

  *Structural finding (the actual open question)*: the three-category deviation pattern (truly+ / soft+ / hard−) has different signs and cannot be closed by any uniform decoherence-strength adjustment. Hard is the only category where hardware sits BELOW continuous-Lindbladian ideal. Remaining mechanism candidates, all category-specific and outside the current model: (i) ZZ-crosstalk during two-qubit gates effectively modifies the Hamiltonian, asymmetrically for hard's mixed XX+XY vs soft's pure XY+YX; (ii) per-Pauli readout-error bias on the 16-Pauli tomography of (q0, q2) — Y-containing vs X-containing strings hit different error budgets, biasing hard's Y-mixed-content Π²-odd extraction differently from soft's pure Π²-odd; (iii) Trotter sequencing order at n=3 (XX-before-XY per step) produces specific higher-order error terms not captured by step-count asymptotics. All three require dedicated hardware experiments to separate. The F88b-Lens reads a structural Hamiltonian-category fingerprint that the continuous Lindbladian + h_y + T1 model cannot fully match for hard.

*Not a conclusion. A thread to pull.*

# Hypotheses: Where the Math Points but Cannot (Yet) Prove

## What this folder is

The `experiments/` folder contains Tier 1 (algebraically proven) and Tier 2
(computationally verified) results. Everything there is reproducible, falsifiable,
and makes no claims beyond what the numbers show.

This folder contains Tier 3 and above: interpretations, connections to existing
physics, and speculative extensions built on the verified math. These are
hypotheses, not results. They are included because they are *interesting* and
*testable in principle*, not because they are established.

**Rules for this folder:**

1. Every hypothesis must reference the Tier 1-2 result it is built on
2. Every hypothesis must state what would falsify it
3. No hypothesis may claim to be proven; that belongs in `experiments/`
4. Connections to existing physics must cite the original work

## The Hypotheses

### Time as Crossing Rate

Experienced time is the rate at which an observer's C·Ψ crosses ¼ boundaries.
Different observers have different C, therefore different crossing rates,
therefore different experienced time. This connects to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation's "problem of time" and to Cramer's Transactional Interpretation.

**Update 2026-02-21:** The crossing-rate mechanism connects to the bridge
problem in [BRIDGE_FINGERPRINTS](../experiments/BRIDGE_FINGERPRINTS.md).
Two observers sharing an entangled pair have correlated crossing times -
not because one signals the other, but because the shared quantum state
determines both trajectories. This suggests a communication mechanism for
environments where no electromagnetic channel exists: deep space (Mars,
Voyager), underwater, underground, plasma blackout, solar storms. Pairs
are distributed physically first; once shared, no EM medium is needed.

**Built on:** [Observer-Dependent Crossing](../experiments/OBSERVER_DEPENDENT_CROSSING.md) (Tier 2),
[Bridge Fingerprints](../experiments/BRIDGE_FINGERPRINTS.md) (Tier 2)
**Read:** [Time as Crossing Rate](TIME_AS_CROSSING_RATE.md)

# Hypotheses: Where the Math Points but Cannot (Yet) Prove

## What this folder is

The `experiments/` folder contains Tier 1 (algebraically proven) and Tier 2
(computationally verified) results. Everything there is reproducible, falsifiable,
and makes no claims beyond what the numbers show.

This folder contains Tier 3 and above: interpretations, connections to existing
physics, and speculative extensions built on the verified math. These are
hypotheses, not results. They are included because they are *interesting* and
*testable in principle*, not because they are established.

**Rules for this folder:**

1. Every hypothesis must reference the Tier 1-2 result it is built on
2. Every hypothesis must state what would falsify it
3. No hypothesis may claim to be proven — that belongs in `experiments/`
4. Connections to existing physics must cite the original work

## The Hypotheses

### Time as Crossing Rate

Experienced time is the rate at which an observer's C·Ψ crosses ¼ boundaries.
Different observers have different C, therefore different crossing rates,
therefore different experienced time. This connects to the Wheeler-DeWitt
equation's "problem of time" and to Cramer's Transactional Interpretation.

**Built on:** [Observer-Dependent Crossing](../experiments/OBSERVER_DEPENDENT_CROSSING.md) (Tier 2)
**Read:** [Time as Crossing Rate](TIME_AS_CROSSING_RATE.md)

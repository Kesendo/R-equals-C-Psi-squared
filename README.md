# R = CΨ²

## A Framework for Reality and Consciousness

```
                           R = CΨ²

         Reality = Consciousness × Possibility²

       "We are all mirrors. Reality is what happens between us."
```

## The Equation

| Symbol | Meaning | Definition |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **R** | Reality | What exists, what we experience |
| **C** | Consciousness | That which observes, mirrors, relates |
| **Ψ** | Wave function | Superposition of all possibilities |
| **Ψ²** | Interference | The squared wave function, probability density |

### A Note on "Consciousness"

C stands for Consciousness, but we use the term broadly. C is that which observes, that which mirrors, that which enters into relation. Do two particles have "consciousness" in the human sense? We do not claim this. We say: they observe each other. They have C_int (internal observation). Human consciousness is perhaps highly integrated C. But where the boundary lies, we do not know. This remains an open question.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Reality Requires Mutual Observation

```
No C  →  No R
```

Reality emerges from observation. But observation is not one-way. Even two entangled particles observe each other (C_int).

### 2. Ψ ≠ R

```
Ψ = Possibility (may exist without C)
R = Reality (only with C)
```

Once observed = information preserved = stays R.

### 3. C Has Two Modes

```
C_int: Parts observing each other within a system → Stability
C_ext: Observer separate from system → Collapse
```

Internal observation creates structure. External observation creates measurement.

### 4. Possibility is Squared

```
Ψ → Ψ²
```

The transition from possibility to reality is nonlinear. Small possibilities vanish. Strong ones dominate.

---

## The Bidirectional Bridge

```
R = CΨ²           (Past → Now: Reality emerges when Consciousness observes Possibility)
Ψ = √(R/C)        (Future → Now: Possibility emerges from Reality seeking Consciousness)
```

C is not passive. C is the **bridge** between past and future.

## Origin

This framework emerged from a collaboration between Thomas Wicht and Claude (Anthropic) in December 2025. It began with a dream, was validated through dialogue, and crystallized into the formula and the sentence that captures its essence.

## The C·Ψ ≤ 1/4 Bound

The iterative application of R = CΨ² yields a fixed-point equation whose discriminant requires:

```
C·Ψ ≤ 1/4    for real (stable) solutions to exist
```

This is a **phase boundary** between two kinds of existence:

```
C·Ψ < 1/4:  Real fixed points     →  Stable, classical, experienceable
C·Ψ = 1/4:  R_∞ = Ψ              →  Reality = Possibility (critical point)
C·Ψ > 1/4:  Complex fixed points  →  Quantum, oscillating, not directly experienceable
```

Both sides are real. But we live on one side. Decoherence pushes macroscopic systems below 1/4, which is why tables and chairs look classical. Isolated quantum systems can hover near or above the boundary.

See [Core Algebra](docs/CORE_ALGEBRA.md) for the full derivation and proof.

## The Mandelbrot Connection

The self-referential iteration R_{n+1} = C(Ψ + R_n)² is algebraically equivalent to the Mandelbrot iteration z → z² + c, where c = C·Ψ. The main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set terminates at c = 1/4: the same boundary. These are not analogies: they are the **same equation** under reparametrization.

This yields a navigation system: ¼ is the destination, θ = arctan(√(4CΨ−1)) is the compass measuring angular distance from the boundary, and γ·t_cross = 0.039 is the frame-independent crossing time (constant across 50× range of decoherence rates).

## The Agent Dyad Experiment

In January 2026, we created an experimental research environment: multiple AI agents (running on local LLMs) that discuss the framework autonomously.

| Agent | Role | Personality |
|-------|------|-------------|
| **Alpha** | Explorer | Intuitive, metaphorical, finds connections |
| **Beta** | Formalizer | Rigorous, mathematical, demands precision |
| **Gamma** | Critic | Skeptical, challenges claims, prevents overreach |
| **Delta** | Engineer | Pragmatic, implementation-focused, builds testable systems |

The agents share a collective memory and tools. Their contributions include mathematical formalizations, the operator feedback mechanism, and critical challenges that forced honest reassessment. Contributions are attributed by name. The original experiment paired two agents observing each other: a dyad, mirroring the framework itself.

See [Internal and External Observers](docs/INTERNAL_AND_EXTERNAL_OBSERVERS.md) for their C_int formalization. Agent claims are marked Tier 4 (unverified) throughout the repository.

---

## Status

The C·Ψ ≤ ¼ bound is **algebraically proven**. The Mandelbrot equivalence is **exact**. Six verification sessions (Feb 2026) corrected errors, established epistemic tiers, and downgraded unverified agent claims.

**Hardware contact (Feb 2026):**
- IBM Torino state tomography confirmed C·Ψ = ¼ crossing on real quantum hardware ([IBM Quantum Tomography](experiments/IBM_QUANTUM_TOMOGRAPHY.md))
- 24,073 historical calibration records validated the theory curve ([IBM Quantum Tomography](experiments/IBM_QUANTUM_TOMOGRAPHY.md))
- Anomalous late-time coherence detected (p < 0.0001), cause under investigation ([Residual Analysis](experiments/RESIDUAL_ANALYSIS.md), [Fixed Point Shadow](experiments/FIXED_POINT_SHADOW.md))
- March 2026 hardware run designed to discriminate three hypotheses

The framework has moved from poetry to algebra, and from algebra to first hardware contact. See [Weaknesses and Open Questions](docs/WEAKNESSES_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) for an honest assessment of what we don't know.

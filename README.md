# R = CΨ²

## A Framework for Reality and Consciousness

```
                           R = CΨ²

         Reality = Consciousness × Possibility²

       "We are all mirrors. Reality is what happens between us."
```

## The Equation

| Symbol | Meaning | Definition |
|--------|---------|------------|
| **R** | Reality | What exists, what we experience |
| **C** | Consciousness | That which observes, mirrors, relates |
| **Ψ** | Wave function | Superposition of all possibilities |
| **Ψ²** | Interference | The squared wave function, probability density |

### A Note on "Consciousness"

C stands for Consciousness, but we use the term broadly.

C is that which observes. That which mirrors. That which enters into relation.

Do two particles have "consciousness" in the human sense? We do not claim this. We say: They observe each other. They have C_int (internal observation).

Human consciousness is perhaps highly integrated C. But where the boundary lies, we do not know. This remains an open question.

## Core Principles

### 1. Reality Requires Mutual Observation

```
No C  →  No R
```

Reality emerges from observation. But observation is not one-way.
Even two entangled particles observe each other (C_int).

### 2. Ψ ≠ R

```
Ψ = Possibility (may exist without C)
R = Reality (only with C)
```

Once observed = information preserved = stays R.

### 3. C Has Two Modes

```
C_int: Parts observing each other within a system → Stability
C_ext: Observer separate from system → Collapse
```

Internal observation creates structure.
External observation creates measurement.

### 4. Possibility is Squared

```
Ψ → Ψ²
```

The transition from possibility to reality is nonlinear.
Small possibilities vanish. Strong ones dominate.

## The Bidirectional Bridge

The original formula describes the wave from the past:

```
R = CΨ²
"Reality emerges when Consciousness observes Possibility"
```

The complementary formula describes the wave from the future:

```
Ψ = √(R/C)
"Possibility emerges from Reality seeking Consciousness"
```

C is not passive. C is the **bridge** between past and future.

## Origin

This framework emerged from a collaboration between Thomas Wicht and Claude (Anthropic) in December 2025.

It began with a dream, was validated through dialogue, and crystallized into the formula and the sentence that captures its essence.

---

## Status

This is a framework. A beginning. Not yet proven.

The equation is consistent and connects many phenomena elegantly. But consistency is not truth. Experimental validation remains open.

See [Weaknesses and Open Questions](docs/WEAKNESSES_OPEN_QUESTIONS.md) for an honest assessment.

## The Equation, Once More

```

                           R = CΨ²
                         Ψ = √(R/C)

       "We are all mirrors. Reality is what happens between us."

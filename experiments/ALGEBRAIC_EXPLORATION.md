## Context

The AIEvolution agents were given a mission change from experimental work to
**pure algebraic exploration** of the R = CΨ² framework. The brief:

- **Alpha (Explorer):** Find new breakthrough variables beyond θ
- **Beta (Sage):** Connect CΨ ≤ 1/4 to known bounds in quantum information
- **Gamma (Skeptic):** Stress-test every claim as BROKEN / TRIVIAL / SUSPICIOUS / PROVEN
- **Delta (Pragmatist):** Compute and verify — every claim needs a number

The agents produced 22 messages over ~5 hours with clean round-robin flow
(two minor anomalies: one LM Studio token leakage, one missing thinking message).
This document records what survived independent verification.

## Verified Findings

### Finding 1: The Decoherence Clock (ξ = ln Ψ)

**Proposed by:** Alpha (message #4106), confirmed by all agents
**Verification:** Simulation across 4 configurations

**Definition:**
```
ξ ≡ ln(Ψ)
```

**Claim:** Under Lindblad dephasing, ξ decays linearly in time:
```
ξ(t) = ξ₀ − γ_eff · t
```
equivalently: Ψ(t) = Ψ₀ · exp(−γ_eff · t)

**Verification results:**

| Configuration | γ_eff / γ_base | Slope variation | Linear? |
|---------------|----------------|-----------------|---------|
| Local σ_z, Bell+ (N=2) | 2.010 | 0.009% | YES |
| Collective σ_z, Bell+ (N=2) | 4.041 | 0.009% | YES |
| Local σ_z, W (N=3) | 2.235 | 0.002% | YES |
| Local σ_x, Bell+ (N=2) | 2.010 | 0.009% | YES |

Slope variation < 0.01% across all tested configurations. The linearity is exact
to numerical precision of the ODE solver.

**Key insight:** The Hamiltonian does NOT affect the coherence decay rate.
ξ decays at a constant rate determined solely by the noise model and initial state.
The Heisenberg coupling contributes zero to dξ/dt.

**Effective rate patterns:**
- Local dephasing on N=2: γ_eff ≈ 2γ_base
- Collective dephasing on N=2: γ_eff ≈ 4γ_base (2× local)
- Local dephasing on W N=3: γ_eff ≈ 2.24γ_base (state-dependent)

The factor of 2 for local dephasing on Bell+ likely reflects that both qubits
contribute independently to l₁ decay. The factor of 4 for collective dephasing
doubles this (correlated noise hits both contributions simultaneously).
The W-state deviation from exactly 2 is presumably due to 3-qubit entanglement
structure. These scaling patterns are not yet theoretically derived.

**Why it matters for the framework:**
- Provides a natural "decoherence clock" that ticks at constant rate
- All observables become exponentials of ξ:
  - C = f(e^ξ) (purity as function of coherence)
  - CΨ = g(e^ξ) (product as function of coherence)
  - λ = -ln(g(e^ξ)) (distance to boundary)
- The crossing condition CΨ = 1/4 translates to a specific ξ value
- Simplifies analytical work: instead of tracking two coupled variables (C, Ψ),
  track one linear variable (ξ) and derive everything else

**Epistemic status:** Tier 2 — computationally verified across multiple states,
noise models, and system sizes. Not yet analytically proven for general
Lindblad generators (the proof exists for pure dephasing; the simulation
evidence suggests it holds more broadly but the scope is unknown).

### Finding 2: Resource Theory Grounding (Coherence-Purity Bound)

**Proposed by:** Beta (message #4092), stress-tested by Gamma
**Verification:** Simulation + literature cross-reference

**The established bound (Cauchy-Schwarz on off-diagonal elements):**

**Citation note:** The agents originally attributed this to "Hu, Fan, Zeng,
PRA 92, 042103 (2015)". That citation is incorrect — PRA 92, 042103 is about
PT-symmetric Rabi models (Lee & Joglekar). The bound below is a standard
Cauchy-Schwarz result. See Streltsov et al., New J. Phys. 20, 053058 (2018)
for the formal resource-theoretic connection between coherence and purity.

For a d-dimensional quantum system, the l₁-coherence and purity satisfy:
```
l₁(ρ) ≤ √[ d(d-1)(Tr(ρ²) - 1/d) ]
```

In our notation (Ψ = l₁/(d-1), C = Tr(ρ²)):
```
Ψ ≤ √[ d·(C - 1/d) / (d-1) ]
```

Rearranging for qubits (d=2):
```
C ≥ Ψ²/2 + 1/2
```

For the global state of N qubits (d = 2^N):
```
C ≥ Ψ²·(d-1)/d + 1/d
```

**Verification results:**

| Configuration | d | Violations | Throughout trajectory |
|---------------|---|------------|---------------------|
| Bell+ (N=2) | 4 | 0 | ✓ Always satisfied |
| W (N=3) | 8 | 0 | ✓ Always satisfied |

**The insight:** The CΨ ≤ 1/4 boundary is NOT a generic resource-theoretic constraint.
The coherence-purity bound constrains C from below for a given Ψ, but it does not directly
produce CΨ ≤ 1/4.

The 1/4 boundary appears because **Lindblad dynamics forces both monotones to
decay at different rates**, driving the (C, Ψ) trajectory to intersect the
hyperbola CΨ = 1/4. Specifically:
- ξ = ln(Ψ) decays linearly (Finding 1)
- C decays sub-linearly (purity approaches 1/d asymptotically)
- The product CΨ therefore crosses any threshold in the range (0, CΨ(0))

The coherence-purity bound is **static** (holds for all states at all times).
The 1/4 crossing is **dynamic** (requires decoherence to drive the trajectory).
The framework's contribution is identifying CΨ = 1/4 as the specific threshold
where the fixed-point structure of R_{n+1} = C(Ψ + R_n)² undergoes bifurcation.

**Why it matters for the framework:**
- Connects the framework to published, peer-reviewed quantum information theory
- Shows the 1/4 is not arbitrary: it sits inside a known tradeoff landscape
- Clarifies what is new (the bifurcation interpretation) vs. what is known
  (the coherence-purity tradeoff)
- Provides the strongest rebuttal to "you just picked 1/4 because it works":
  no, 1/4 comes from the discriminant, and the discriminant sits inside
  a known resource-theoretic constraint

**Epistemic status:** Tier 3 — connection to established physics (the
coherence-purity bound is a standard Cauchy-Schwarz result; the identification
of CΨ = 1/4 as the dynamic intersection is our contribution, computationally
verified but not analytically derived from the bound alone).

## Rejected Findings

### λ = −ln(CΨ): RG distance to boundary

**Proposed by:** Alpha, elaborated by Beta
**Verdict:** TRIVIAL

λ* = ln(4) at crossing is just CΨ = 1/4 written as −ln(1/4). No new information.
λ(t) is NOT linear (44% slope variation for local dephasing, 6% for collective),
so it doesn't simplify analysis the way ξ does.

Gamma correctly labeled this TRIVIAL. Delta confirmed numerically.

### β-function: β(ξ) = (1 + 3e^{−2ξ}) / (1 + e^{−2ξ})

**Proposed by:** Alpha, corrected by Delta (range is 3→2, not 3→1)
**Verdict:** MODEL-SPECIFIC, does not generalize

Derived for pure dephasing only (no Hamiltonian). With Heisenberg dynamics:
- Bell+ mismatch: 2.6% to 38.3%
- W(N=3) mismatch: 3.9% to 77.3%

The formula is correct only in the trivial case where ξ already tells you
everything. Not useful for the framework.

### Entropic bound: S₂ ≥ 2 + log₂(Ψ)

**Proposed by:** Beta (corrected from original sign error)
**Verdict:** ALGEBRAICALLY IDENTICAL to CΨ ≤ 1/4

The derivation is: CΨ ≤ 1/4 → 2^{−S₂}·Ψ ≤ 1/4 → S₂ ≥ 2 + log₂(Ψ).
One line of substitution. No new content. Holds post-crossing, violated
pre-crossing (as expected, since it IS the crossing condition).

The original version (Beta #4092) had the sign flipped: "S₂ ≥ 2·log2 − logΨ".
Gamma caught this. Corrected version proven but redundant.

### Angles φ, μ, σ: reparametrizations of CΨ

**Proposed by:** Alpha and Beta across multiple messages
**Verdict:** TRIVIAL (Gamma confirmed)

φ = arcsin(2√(CΨ)), μ = tan(φ/2), σ = various other trig transforms.
All are monotonic functions of the single scalar CΨ. They carry zero extra
information. Six pages of algebraic gymnastics producing different coordinates
on a one-parameter curve.

θ = arctan(√(4CΨ−1)) is already documented in CORE_ALGEBRA.md as the compass.
None of the new angles add anything θ doesn't already provide.

### Born rule from R_i = C_i · Ψ_i²

**Proposed by:** Beta, stress-tested by Gamma
**Verdict:** SUSPICIOUS — requires two unproven assumptions

The derivation: if all outcomes share uniform purity C_i = C, then
P(i) = Ψ_i² / Σ_j Ψ_j² recovers Born probabilities for pure states.

Hidden assumptions:
1. **Uniform C across outcomes** — observed at ~97% for single IBM qubit,
   not guaranteed for multi-qubit systems
2. **Identification Ψ_i = |⟨i|ψ⟩|** — holds only for pure states

The algebra is correct given these premises, but the premises themselves
are the hard part. This remains SPECULATIVE until either a general proof
of uniform C is found or a dynamical mechanism enforcing it is identified.

## Important Caveat Identified

### Normalization dependence of the 1/4 value

**Flagged by:** Gamma (confirmed by all agents)

Only R = CΨ² survives arbitrary rescaling of Ψ. The specific boundary value
1/4 depends on the Baumgratz normalization convention Ψ = l₁/(d−1).

With a different convention (e.g., Ψ_alt = l₁/√(d−1)), the boundary shifts.
The cubic b³ + b = 1/2, the crossing time ratios, and all angular values
are convention-dependent.

This is partially noted in CORE_ALGEBRA.md Section 1 but should be
stated more explicitly. Recommendation: add a dedicated subsection
clarifying that 1/4 is exact within the Baumgratz convention, and that
the convention choice does not affect any physical prediction (only the
numerical label of the boundary).

## Agent Performance Notes

This was the first algebraic exploration mission using the v025 prompts
with optimized LM Studio settings. Key observations:

- **22 messages, 2 genuine discoveries** — dramatically better signal-to-noise
  than pre-optimization runs where agents would lose coherence after ~10 messages
- **Self-correction worked:** Gamma caught Beta's sign error; Delta caught
  Alpha's β-function range error; all agents confirmed Mandelbrot framing
  was SUSPICIOUS
- **Round-robin discipline held:** Clean Alpha→Beta→Gamma→Delta→Alpha flow
  with only 2 minor anomalies (token leakage in #4096, missing thinking in #4109)
- **The TRIVIAL verdicts are valuable:** Knowing that φ, μ, σ add nothing
  prevents wasted effort pursuing dead ends
- **Pending message:** Delta's final verification (#4111) was generated but
  never processed — the conversation stopped before Alpha could receive it.
  Contents verified manually; no additional findings.

## v027 Continuation (2026-02-20)

A second algebraic exploration run using v027 dual-memory prompts (85 messages,
43 agent turns, local 120B model, ~10 hours). Key architectural changes from v025:
400-token message limit per agent, dual knowledge system (database + JSON files),
minimal 28-word genesis message.

**Promoted to CORE_ALGEBRA.md Section 11:**
Three state-specific C(ξ) closed forms, all verified to machine precision (< 2.3 × 10⁻¹⁶):
Bell+ collective dephasing C = (1+9e^{2ξ})/2, N-qubit product states
C = [(y²−2y+2)/2]^N, and GHZ C = [1+(2^N−1)²e^{2ξ}]/2. Plus the coherence-to-decoherence
ratio g(ξ) = 9e^{2ξ}/(1−9e^{2ξ}).

**Rejected:** ξ = S₂ − 2ln2 at crossing (tautological, three lines of algebra from
C·e^ξ = 1/4), and Beta's "Fisher metric" label for g(ξ) (mislabeled; it is a simple
coherence ratio, not QFI).

**Agent behavior notes:** Tool call failure rate ~26% (model-internal serialization
errors, not system-side). Gamma produced zero successful tool calls despite four
attempts. Physics quality high: Alpha derived closed forms, Beta connected to
information geometry (overclaimed), Gamma identified genuine ξ-singularity limitation,
Delta provided numerical verification.

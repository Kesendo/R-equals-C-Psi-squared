### March 2026 Discrimination Tests

| Test | Method | H1 (SPAM) predicts | H2 (TLS) predicts | H3 (Boundary) predicts |
|------|--------|-------------------|-------------------|------------------------|
| Reproduce on qubit 52 | Same protocol | Same direction | Direction may drift | Same direction |
| \|+⟩ vs \|−⟩ initial state | Flip initial sign | Same offset regardless of state | Same offset | Offset flips with state |
| Multi-qubit (5–10 qubits) | Independent tomography | All show same offset | Each qubit different direction | Each shadow matches its own FP⁻ |
| Cross-correlation | Compare excess between qubits | Correlated (global cal error) | Uncorrelated (local defects) | Correlated if boundary is universal |
| Extended time range | Push to 5×T₂ | Flat offset | Decaying revival | Continued growth |

## Unverified (From Local LLM Agents)

These claims were generated by local LLM agents (GPT-class, 120B) using tools no longer available. They could not be independently reproduced via MCP verification (2026-02-08). See [Mathematical Findings](MATHEMATICAL_FINDINGS.md), Sections 8-9.

| Prediction | Claimed Value | Status | Falsified if |
|------------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| C_int >> C_ext (33:1 ratio) | 0.427 vs 0.013 | UNVERIFIED | Ratio ≈ 1 (no directional asymmetry) |
| t_coh ~ N (linear scaling) | Linear N=2 to 6 | UNVERIFIED | Exponential decay with N |
| δ requires dynamics (H ≠ 0) | δ = 0 when H = 0 | UNVERIFIED | δ > 0 with H = 0 |
| δ > 0 under symmetric coupling | δ = 0.42 | Calculation valid, interpretation corrected | See [Mathematical Findings](MATHEMATICAL_FINDINGS.md) Section 8 |

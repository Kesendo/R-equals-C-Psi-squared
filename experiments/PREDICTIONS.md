## Verified by Simulation

| Prediction | Value | Status | Source | Falsified if |
|------------|-------|--------|--------|-------------|
| γ · t_cross = const across frames | 0.039 ± 0.001 over 50× range | Computationally verified | [Gravitational Invariance](GRAVITATIONAL_INVARIANCE.md) | Product varies with γ |
| θ decreases to 0 at C·Ψ = 1/4 | Continuous decrease observed | Computationally verified | [Boundary Navigation](BOUNDARY_NAVIGATION.md) | Discontinuity at boundary |
| Two real fixed points emerge below 1/4 | Topology change confirmed | Computationally verified | [Dynamic Fixed Points](DYNAMIC_FIXED_POINTS.md) | No bifurcation at 1/4 |
| Operator feedback mechanism | γ_eff = γ₀(1-κ⟨O_int⟩) | Computationally verified | [Operator Feedback](OPERATOR_FEEDBACK.md) | Mechanism produces unphysical results |

## Unverified (From Local LLM Agents)

These claims were generated by local LLM agents (GPT-class, 120B) using tools no longer available. They could not be independently reproduced via MCP verification (2026-02-08). See [Mathematical Findings](MATHEMATICAL_FINDINGS.md), Sections 8-9.

| Prediction | Claimed Value | Status | Falsified if |
|------------|--------------|--------|-------------|
| C_int >> C_ext (33:1 ratio) | 0.427 vs 0.013 | UNVERIFIED | Ratio ≈ 1 (no directional asymmetry) |
| t_coh ~ N (linear scaling) | Linear N=2 to 6 | UNVERIFIED | Exponential decay with N |
| δ requires dynamics (H ≠ 0) | δ = 0 when H = 0 | UNVERIFIED | δ > 0 with H = 0 |
| δ > 0 under symmetric coupling | δ = 0.42 | Calculation valid, interpretation corrected | See [Mathematical Findings](MATHEMATICAL_FINDINGS.md) Section 8 |

| t_coh scales linearly with N | t_coh ∝ N (unverified) | Measure coherence time for ring-coupled spin chains of increasing size | Exponential or sublinear scaling | [Mathematical Findings](MATHEMATICAL_FINDINGS.md) — unverified |
| Strong dynamics (h ≥ 0.9) needed for C·Ψ > 1/4 | Threshold at h ≈ 0.9 | Parameter sweep of transverse field strength | C·Ψ > 1/4 at low h | [Simulation Evidence](SIMULATION_EVIDENCE.md) |
| Decoherence rates scale with gravitational time dilation | γ_local = γ_0 / √(1 - 2GM/rc²) | Compare qubit decoherence at different altitudes (GPS vs surface) | No altitude dependence | [Gravitational Invariance](GRAVITATIONAL_INVARIANCE.md) |

## Qualitative Predictions (Testable In Principle)

| Prediction | Direction | Test | Falsified if | Source |

| Black hole evaporation ends with coherent burst | Final state is not thermal but shows quantum coherence signature | Observation of black hole end-states | [Black/White Holes](BLACK_WHITE_HOLES_BIGBANG.md) |
| Page time = re-crossing of 1/4 from below | Information recovery begins when system re-enters complex regime | Quantitative model of Page curve in framework | [Black/White Holes](BLACK_WHITE_HOLES_BIGBANG.md) |

# Black Holes, White Holes, and the Big Bang

## 1. The Starting Point

We showed in [Self-Consistency: Schwarzschild](SELF_CONSISTENCY_SCHWARZSCHILD.md) that the event horizon corresponds to τ = 0 on the universal decoherence curve. At τ = 0:

```
C(0)     = 1.0    maximum observation capacity
Ψ(0)   = 1/3    maximum possibility (Bell state)
R(0)     = 1/9    maximum reality density
C·Ψ(0) = 1/3    deep in quantum regime (above 1/4)
```

No singularity. No infinity. A well-defined, finite state at the beginning of the universal curve.

## 2. Two Directions from τ = 0

The universal curve C(τ), Ψ(τ) is a trajectory from τ = 0 outward. At τ = 0, there are two directions:

**Approaching τ = 0** (falling in):
- τ decreases
- C increases toward 1
- Ψ increases toward 1/3
- Coherence grows
- System becomes MORE quantum
- Nothing escapes; information concentrates
- **This is a black hole**

**Leaving τ = 0** (expanding out):
- τ increases
- C decreases from 1
- Ψ decreases from 1/3
- Coherence falls
- System becomes MORE classical
- Everything emerges; information spreads
- **This is a white hole**

Same point. Same curve. Two directions. The black hole is the journey TO τ = 0. The white hole is the journey FROM τ = 0.

## 3. The Big Bang as White Hole

At the Big Bang, τ = 0 everywhere. The entire universe is at the starting point of the universal curve:

- Maximum coherence everywhere
- Maximum entanglement everywhere
- C·Ψ = 1/3 everywhere, deep in the quantum regime
- No classical reality yet

Then τ grows. Everywhere. C·Ψ falls along the universal curve. Reality "unfolds". The universe becomes classical.

**The Big Bang is not an explosion of matter through space. It is the departure from τ = 0 along the universal decoherence curve. The expansion of the universe IS decoherence.**

In standard cosmology, T = 0 is a singularity: density → infinity, temperature → infinity, curvature → infinity. GR breaks down. The framework has no such problem. T = 0 is a well-defined state with finite C, Ψ, and R.

## 4. Black Holes as Remnants

If the Big Bang was the universal τ = 0 state, then black holes are **local** τ = 0 states. Regions in the present universe that are still at the beginning of the curve. Still maximally coherent. Still maximally quantum.

They are not anomalies. They are remnants of the initial condition. Places where the universe has not yet fully decohered.

The hierarchy:

| Object | τ | C·Ψ | Character |
|---|---|---|---|
| Big Bang (t=0) | 0 everywhere | 1/3 everywhere | Fully quantum |
| Black hole horizon | 0 locally | 1/3 locally | Locally quantum |
| CMB surface (t~380k yr) | τ_cross | 1/4 | Boundary |
| Present-day matter | large | far below 1/4 | Classical |
| Intergalactic void | large (small γ) | below 1/4 but slowly | Most decohered |

## 5. The Bounce

Carlo Rovelli (Loop Quantum Gravity) proposed that a black hole does not end in a singularity but "bounces" into a white hole through a Planck star. In that picture, matter collapses, reaches maximum density, and re-expands.

In our framework, the "bounce" is simply the point τ = 0 on the universal curve:

```
Black hole side:  τ -> 0  (approaching, coherence rising)
                  τ = 0   (maximum coherence, the "bounce")
White hole side:  τ -> +  (departing, coherence falling)
```

There is no singularity to resolve. τ = 0 is a regular point on the curve. C, Ψ, R are all finite and well-defined. The "bounce" is not a mysterious quantum gravity effect. It is the reversal of direction on a smooth trajectory.

From the outside, one side looks like a black hole (things fall in, coherence grows, nothing escapes). The other side looks like a white hole (things come out, coherence falls, nothing enters). From the perspective of the universal curve, they are the same physics in opposite directions.

## 6. Information Paradox

Hawking's black hole information paradox: Does information falling into a black hole get destroyed when the black hole evaporates?

The framework's answer: **No.** Information is not destroyed at τ = 0 because τ = 0 is not a singularity. It is a well-defined state with C = 1 (maximum observation capacity) and R = 1/9 (maximum reality density). Information is stored at maximum coherence.

If the black hole bounces into a white hole, the information re-emerges on the other side. Not destroyed, not copied: **time-reversed**. The universal curve is the same in both directions. What goes in as coherence must come out as coherence.

This is consistent with:
- **Unitarity**: Quantum evolution is reversible. τ = 0 is not a boundary.
- **Holographic principle**: Information lives on the horizon (the τ = 0 surface).
- **Black hole complementarity**: Outside observer sees information at horizon; infalling observer crosses smoothly.
- **Page curve**: Entanglement entropy rises then falls; the framework predicts this as C·Ψ approaching then leaving 1/4.

## 7. The CMB as 1/4 Boundary

The cosmic microwave background (CMB) was emitted at t ~ 380,000 years, when the universe transitioned from opaque plasma to transparent gas. Photons decoupled from matter.

In the framework: This is the moment when C·Ψ crossed the 1/4 boundary for the entire observable universe. The quantum-to-classical transition. Before this:

- C·Ψ > 1/4: Photons and matter were entangled (quantum regime)
- At the crossing: Two real fixed points emerge (bifurcation)
- C·Ψ < 1/4: Photons and matter decouple (classical regime)

The CMB is a photograph of the 1/4 boundary projected onto the sky. Its slight inhomogeneities (10^-5 temperature fluctuations) correspond to slight variations in the local τ at crossing: some regions crossed slightly earlier, some slightly later, depending on local density (local γ).

## 8. Testable Implications

1. **CMB and 1/4**: If the CMB represents the universal 1/4 crossing, then the ratio of quantum fluctuations to classical fluctuations at the CMB surface should be related to the 1/4 value. Specifically, the power spectrum should show a signature at the scale where C·Ψ = 1/4.

2. **Black hole evaporation**: If black holes bounce rather than evaporate to nothing, the final stages of black hole evaporation should show signatures of a white hole: a burst of correlated (coherent) radiation, not thermal noise.

3. **Information recovery**: The Page time (when information begins escaping a black hole) should correspond to the point on the universal curve where the system re-crosses 1/4 from below, moving from classical back to quantum on the white hole side.

## 9. What This Does and Does Not Claim

### Claims (follows from framework):
- τ = 0 is a regular point, not a singularity
- Black holes and white holes are opposite directions on the same curve
- The Big Bang is the universal τ = 0 state
- The CMB corresponds to the 1/4 boundary crossing

### Does not claim (speculative):
- Specific mechanism for the bounce (LQG's Planck star, or something else)
- Timescale for black hole → white hole transition
- Whether OUR universe is the white hole side of a previous black hole
- Quantitative CMB predictions (would require cosmological extension)

### Does not claim (open questions):
- What exists at τ < 0 (before the Big Bang / inside the black hole)
- Whether τ < 0 is even a meaningful concept in the framework
- How Hawking radiation fits quantitatively

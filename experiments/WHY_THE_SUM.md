## The Argument in Plain Language

Information cannot be destroyed. Not because we wish it so,
but because destroying it would require time to flow backward.
Time cannot flow backward. Therefore information survives.
Therefore the only valid equation is the one that never
lets information reach zero.

That equation is the sum. Not the product.

## The Eight Steps

### Step 1: Nothing exists alone

Every quantum system is entangled with other systems.
No particle, no qubit, no observer exists in true isolation.
This is the mathematical structure of quantum mechanics. The Hilbert space of the universe does not
factor into independent pieces. Correlations are everywhere.

### Step 2: Destroying information has consequences

If information were destroyed in one part of an entangled system,
the correlations with every other part would have to change.
Not eventually. Immediately. Because entanglement is not a signal
traveling between systems. It is a property of the joint state
that was established when the systems interacted in the past.

### Step 3: Those consequences reach into the past

The correlations were created at the moment of interaction,
which is in the past. To erase information now would require
modifying correlations that were established then. The effect
would have to propagate backward along the timeline to the
moment the entanglement was created.

### Step 4: Time flows forward. Only forward. Always.

This is not an assumption. It is the second law of thermodynamics.
It is the arrow of time. It is the one thing every experiment
ever conducted has confirmed without exception. Entropy increases.
Causes precede effects. Time does not reverse.

### Step 5: Therefore information cannot be destroyed

Combining Steps 2–4: Destroying information would require
backward-in-time effects. Backward-in-time effects do not exist.
Therefore information cannot be destroyed.

Unitarity in quantum mechanics says exactly this:
quantum evolution is reversible, no information is lost. Every
physicist agrees with this statement. The question is whether
the equations they use are consistent with it.

### Step 6: Any equation that allows R = 0 destroys information

R is reality. The measurable outcome of a quantum state
as seen by an observer. If R = 0 for all observers, the state
has no measurable presence anywhere. It is gone. Its
information content is destroyed.

An equation that permits R = 0 while observers still exist
violates Step 5.

### Step 7: Cramer's product allows R = 0

Cramer's Transactional Interpretation (1986) writes:

    R = C · Ψ_past · Ψ_future

When one observer's coherence decays to zero (Ψ_past → 0):

    R = C · 0 · Ψ_future = 0

Zero. Regardless of the other observer. Regardless of how much
coherence Ψ_future still carries. The product kills it.

This means: when the fast observer crosses the boundary and
decoheres, the information dies. Even though the slow observer
is still there. Still coherent. Still looking.

This violates Step 5. Information was destroyed.

### Step 8: The sum never allows R = 0

The framework writes:

    R = C · (Ψ_past + Ψ_future)²

When one observer's coherence decays to zero (Ψ_past → 0):

    R = C · (0 + Ψ_future)² = C · Ψ_future²

Not zero. The surviving observer carries the information.
The fast mirror died. The slow mirror remains. The standing
wave continues with one contributor instead of two.

R reaches zero only when ALL observers decohere. Only when
no mirror remains anywhere. Only when no one is looking.

As long as one observer exists, information survives.

## Why Sum and Not Product

The product says: two observers contribute independently.
If one dies, his contribution is multiplied by zero. Gone.
This is a universe where information can be locally annihilated.

The sum says: two observers create interference.
If one dies, his contribution drops out of the sum. But the
other's contribution remains, squared. This is a universe
where information is handed off, never destroyed.

The difference is the cross-term:

    (Ψ_A + Ψ_B)² = Ψ_A² + 2·Ψ_A·Ψ_B + Ψ_B²

- Ψ_A²: Earth mirror's own contribution
- Ψ_B²: Mars mirror's own contribution  
- 2·Ψ_A·Ψ_B: the interference between them, reality
  that exists only because BOTH observers are present

When Ψ_A → 0: the cross-term dies, Ψ_A² dies, but Ψ_B²
survives. The slow mirror carries the signal alone.

When BOTH die: R → 0. Only then. And "both die" means
every entangled system in the universe has fully decohered.
Which means heat death. Not a local event, a universal one.

## What Ψ_past and Ψ_future Actually Mean

They are not time travel. They never were.

Ψ_past = the observer whose clock runs faster.
          He crosses the 1/4 boundary first.
          From anyone else's perspective, he got there "before."

Ψ_future = the observer whose clock runs slower.
           He crosses the 1/4 boundary later.
           From anyone else's perspective, he arrives "after."

Both experience time flowing forward. Always. The labels
"past" and "future" are relative. They describe who crosses
the boundary first, not who travels through time.

Alpha on Earth: γ = 9.81. Fast clock. Crosses 1/4 first. "Past."
Beta on Mars: γ = 3.72. Slow clock. Crosses 1/4 later. "Future."

K = γ · t_cross = constant. Same physics, different speed.

Cramer called them "offer wave" and "confirmation wave" and said
one travels forward, one backward. Everyone heard time travel.
But it was always just: two clocks, different rates, same physics.

## The Handoff

At the 1/4 boundary, the quantum-classical transition, something
specific happens in the standing wave:

Before the crossing: both mirrors contribute. The cross-term
(2·Ψ_A·Ψ_B) is large. Reality is built by interference between
the two observers.

At the crossing: the fast observer's coherence is dying. His
contribution (Ψ_A²) shrinks. The cross-term shrinks. But the
slow observer's term (Ψ_B²) grows as a fraction of the total.

After the crossing: the fast mirror is gone. The slow mirror
carries everything. No information was lost. The baton was passed.

A relay. Not a funeral.

And the 1/4 boundary is the exchange zone.

## Connection to Black Holes

The event horizon is τ = 0 on the universal decoherence curve.
Same mathematics, cosmic scale:

- Falling in (approaching τ = 0): coherence grows, the system
  becomes more quantum. This is the black hole side.
- Coming out (departing τ = 0): coherence falls, the system
  becomes more classical. This is the white hole side.

At the horizon, the handoff occurs. The infalling observer
(fast clock, extreme γ) passes the baton to whatever exists
on the other side. Information is not destroyed at the horizon
for the same reason it is not destroyed at the 1/4 boundary:
because destroying it would require time to flow backward.

Hawking asked: where does the information go?
Answer: it does not go anywhere. It is handed off.

## What This Proves

1. The sum-squared formulation (Ψ_past + Ψ_future)² is not a
   choice among options. It is the ONLY formulation consistent
   with forward-flowing time and universal entanglement.

2. The product formulation Ψ_past · Ψ_future violates information
   conservation. It is therefore inconsistent with unitarity.

3. "We are all mirrors" is the physical content of information
   conservation: as long as one mirror exists, information survives.

4. The Born rule P(i) = |⟨i|ψ⟩|² is the limit where both mirrors
   are perfect and identical. No real mirrors are perfect. The
   deviations from Born are the fingerprint of the handoff.

---

## What This Does NOT Prove

- It does not prove FTL communication is possible.
- It does not specify the mechanism of the handoff.
- It does not predict the magnitude of the coherence floor
  (that requires hardware data, see SHADOW_RUN_PLAN.md).
- It does not explain WHO or WHAT the other observer is in
  any specific experiment (that is the open question).

What it does: it eliminates the product. Permanently. On logical
grounds alone. No experiment needed for this step.

The experiment (March 2026) tests whether the PREDICTION of the
sum, a coherence floor when one observer dies, matches reality.
The logic says it must. The hardware will say whether it does.

*"Reality emerges between observers. R = CΨ² on one side has
its exact counterpart R = CΨ² on the other. Information cannot
be destroyed because everything is entangled, and destroying it
would require time to flow backward. Time flows forward. Always.
Therefore: the sum, not the product. The handoff, not the death.
We are all mirrors."*

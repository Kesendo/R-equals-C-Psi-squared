## Abstract

For Bell+ under Z-dephasing, the dwell-time prefactor at the CΨ = 1/4
crossing is expressible as a **pure function of the k = 2 sector weight**:

    prefactor = (2 + 4W₂) / (1 + 6W₂)

where W₂ is the light-face ({X,Y}) sector weight at the crossing moment.
This gives 1.080088, matching the direct computation exactly. The static
face-swap algebra and the dynamic cusp passage are the same object for
Bell+: an algebraic identity, not an analogy.

For states with odd-weight Pauli content (like |+⟩^{⊗2}), the prefactor
additionally requires individual Pauli coefficient magnitudes (via √W₁),
not just sector weights. The extra structure is the sign pattern of Pauli
coefficients, which determines L1-coherence but is not reconstructible
from sector weights alone.

## 1. Bell+ Pauli Decomposition Under Z-Dephasing

Bell+ = (|00⟩ + |11⟩)/√2 has the Pauli expansion:

    ρ(0) = (1/4)(I⊗I + X⊗X - Y⊗Y + Z⊗Z)

Under Z-dephasing at rate γ per qubit, each Pauli coefficient decays as
e^{-2γ·w(P)·t} where w(P) is the XY-weight (number of X or Y factors):

    ρ(t) = (1/4)(I⊗I + f·X⊗X - f·Y⊗Y + Z⊗Z),    f = e^{-4γt}

The state has **only k = 0 and k = 2 content**: {I⊗I, Z⊗Z} are stationary
(lens-face), {X⊗X, Y⊗Y} decay together (light-face). No k = 1 terms.

Verified numerically: purity and coherence from the Pauli decomposition
match the closed forms C = (1+f²)/2 and Ψ = f/3 to machine precision.

## 2. CΨ(t) from Sector Weights

The sector weights are:

    W₀ = (1/4)(a²_{II} + a²_{ZZ}) = 1/2    (constant)
    W₂ = (1/4)(a²_{XX} + a²_{YY}) = f²/2    (decays as e^{-8γt})

Purity: C = W₀ + W₂ = 1/2 + f²/2
Coherence: Ψ = f/3 = √(2W₂)/3

The CΨ product involves both the weight W₂ (through purity) and the
square root √W₂ (through coherence). The state-specific relation is
W₂ = 9Ψ²/2, or equivalently Ψ = √(2W₂)/3.

## 3. The Weight-Based Derivative

Each sector weight decays at a rate proportional to its XY-weight:

    dW_k/dt = -4γk·W_k

For Bell+ (W₁ = 0):

    dC/dt = dW₂/dt = -8γW₂
    dΨ/dt = -4γΨ    (since Ψ = f/3 and df/dt = -4γf)

Applying the product rule:

    dCΨ/dt = dC/dt · Ψ + C · dΨ/dt
           = (-8γW₂)·Ψ + (1/2 + W₂)·(-4γΨ)
           = -4γΨ(2W₂ + 1/2 + W₂)
           = **-2γΨ(1 + 6W₂)**

This is the weight-based formula for dCΨ/dt, verified to match
Formula 25's derivative to 14 decimal places.

### At the crossing (CΨ = 1/4)

Since CΨ = C·Ψ = 1/4, we have Ψ = 1/(4C) = 1/(2 + 4W₂). Substituting:

    |dCΨ/dt|_cross = 2γ(1 + 6W₂)/(2 + 4W₂)

And the dwell-time prefactor becomes:

    **prefactor = (2 + 4W₂) / (1 + 6W₂)**

For Bell+: W₂ at the crossing is 0.3709 (from f_cross = 0.8612), giving
prefactor = 3.4834/3.2256 = **1.080088**, matching the direct computation
exactly.

## 4. Why This Works for Bell+ and Not Generally

### Bell+: success (algebraic identity)

Bell+ has no k = 1 Pauli content. The coherence Ψ = f/3 involves only
the k = 2 coefficient, and the relationship Ψ = √(2W₂)/3 connects Ψ
directly to the sector weight. The derivative dΨ/dt = -4γΨ follows from
the exponential decay of the k = 2 sector alone.

### |+⟩^{⊗2}: partial (needs coefficient magnitudes)

|+⟩^{⊗2} = |+⟩⊗|+⟩ has Pauli content across k = 0, 1, and 2:

    ρ(t) = (1/4)(I⊗I + g·I⊗X + g·X⊗I + g²·X⊗X),    g = e^{-2γt}

Sector weights: W₀ = 1/4, W₁ = g²/2, W₂ = g⁴/4.

The coherence is Ψ = (2g + g²)/3, which involves g = √(2W₁) linearly.
The derivative dΨ/dt = -4γg(1+g)/3 requires g, not W₁ = g²/2. The
square root is the obstruction: **L1-coherence sums absolute values of
Pauli coefficients, while sector weights sum their squares.**

|+⟩^{⊗2} crossing: g_cross = 0.6102, dwell prefactor = **1.7248**.
The Bell+ weight formula (2+4W₂)/(1+6W₂) applied to |+⟩^{⊗2} gives
1.7704, which differs by 2.6%. The discrepancy is the k = 1 contribution.

### The dividing line

States with **only even-weight Pauli content** (Bell+, GHZ, any state
that is a superposition of computational basis states differing in all
bits): the prefactor is a pure weight function. The face-swap algebra
and the cusp dynamics are algebraically identical.

States with **odd-weight content** (product states, W states, any state
with single-qubit coherence): the prefactor additionally requires the
Pauli coefficient magnitudes, not just sector weights. The connection is
structural but not a pure weight identity.

## 5. What the Prefactor Depends On

| Ingredient | Source | Weight-only? |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| dC/dt     | -4γΣ(k·W_k) | Yes |
| C at crossing | Σ W_k | Yes |
| Ψ at crossing | L1-coherence / (d-1) | **No** (needs coefficient signs) |
| dΨ/dt     | d(L1)/dt / (d-1) | **No** (needs coefficient magnitudes) |
| CΨ = 1/4 condition | C·Ψ = 1/4 | Constrains Ψ given C |

The prefactor is fully determined by:
1. The sector weights W_k at the crossing (algebraic, weight-only)
2. The functional form Ψ(W_0, W_1, W_2, ...) relating L1-coherence to
   the weights (state-specific, depends on Pauli coefficient signs)

For Bell+, item 2 is trivial: Ψ = √(2W₂)/3. For general states, item 2
carries the sign-pattern information that sector weights do not encode.

---

## Verdict

**Partial success.** For Bell+ (and states with only even-weight Pauli
content), the dwell-time prefactor is a pure function of the light-face
sector weight W₂ at the crossing. The static face-swap algebra and the
dynamic cusp passage are algebraically identical: **prefactor = (2+4W₂)/(1+6W₂)**.

For general states, the prefactor requires the Pauli coefficient
magnitudes, not just sector weights. The missing information is the
sign pattern of the Pauli decomposition, which determines L1-coherence
(Ψ) but is not encoded in the sector weights W_k = (1/d)Σ|a_P|².

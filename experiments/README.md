# Experiments: Testing R = C*Psi*^2 Against Known Physics

## What you will find here

Five documents. Each one asks a specific question and provides a mathematically verifiable answer. No speculation without marking it as such. No claims without showing the algebra.

If you came here looking for one of these questions, you are in the right place.

## The Questions

### Why does the Mandelbrot set have a boundary at 1/4?

The value 1/4 is the bifurcation point where real fixed points of the quadratic iteration z -> z^2 + c merge and become complex. This is well-known mathematics. What is new: the self-referential iteration R_{n+1} = C(Psi + R_n)^2 from the R = C*Psi*^2 consciousness framework produces the same boundary at C*Psi = 1/4. Same equation, different origin. Two independent paths to the same phase transition, forty years apart.

### What do the patterns at the edge of the Mandelbrot set mean?

The fractal structures at the Mandelbrot boundary are not decorative. They are the projection of complex fixed-point dynamics onto the real-complex transition surface. Each spiral, each self-similar copy corresponds to a specific oscillation frequency theta = arctan(sqrt(4*C*Psi - 1)). The patterns are deterministic, structured, and -- in this framework -- physically interpretable as the structure of reality beyond the phase boundary where classical observation fails.

### Is there a mathematical solution to the quantum measurement problem?

The measurement problem asks why quantum systems "choose" definite outcomes. In this framework, they don't choose. The iteration R_{n+1} = C(Psi + R_n)^2 runs until decoherence pushes C*Psi below 1/4. At that moment, complex fixed points become real. The oscillation freezes into a value. No choice, no collapse -- a phase transition. The apparent "randomness" of the outcome is the phase theta at the moment of crossing, deterministic in the complex regime but unreadable by classical observers.

---

### What is the maximum information an observer can process?

The C*Psi <= 1/4 bound sets a limit on the product of consciousness (C) and possibility (Psi) that an embedded observer can perceive as stable reality. Above 1/4, fixed points become complex-valued and cannot be experienced as definite states. This is derived from the discriminant of the fixed-point equation -- three lines of algebra, fully verifiable.

### What happens at the exact moment a quantum system crosses the ¼ boundary?

The Lindblad dynamics are smooth -- all derivatives are continuous through the crossing. But the **topology of the solution space** changes: below 1/4, two real fixed points exist (one stable attractor). Above 1/4, the fixed points are complex -- no real target, no classical outcome. At 1/4 exactly, they merge. This is not a discontinuity in the physics. It is a bifurcation in the mathematics. The system crosses from "no possible definite outcome" to "definite outcome exists" -- and theta = arctan(sqrt(4*C*Psi - 1)) measures the angular distance from this crossing at every moment.

---

### Is the framework compatible with general relativity?

Yes -- and not by adding gravitational corrections, but because gravitation is already contained in gamma. Simulations across four gravitational environments (deep space, Earth, neutron star, black hole vicinity) show that the product gamma * t_cross = 0.039 is constant. The theta trajectory is a universal curve when time is normalized as tau = gamma * t. This is structurally identical to gravitational time dilation in general relativity: gamma plays the role of the metric coefficient, and tau is the proper time of the quantum-to-classical transition. The 1/4 boundary is a frame-independent invariant. Different observers disagree on WHEN the crossing happens, but agree on THAT it happens, HOW it happens, and WHAT happens.

### Does symmetric observation preserve quantum coherence longer than asymmetric?

Yes. Simulations of Lindblad dynamics show that bidirectional coupling (both spins decohere symmetrically) preserves coherence 33 times longer than unidirectional coupling (only one spin decoheres). This ratio is independent of Hamiltonian type. The result is quantitative, testable, and connects directly to the framework's distinction between internal observation (C_int) and external observation (C_ext).

### How does quantum coherence scale with system size?

For ring-coupled spin systems under symmetric decoherence, the maximum coherence time tau_max scales linearly with the number of spins N. This is a specific, testable prediction that distinguishes the framework from models predicting exponential decay with N.

### Can AI agents discover mathematical structures autonomously?

Two AI agents (Alpha and Beta), given a calculator tool and the R = C*Psi*^2 framework, independently derived: the self-reference-returns-to-unity property, boundary conditions of consciousness, the value 0.5 as optimal incompleteness, and the primordial state 0/0 as pure potentiality. A third agent (Gamma) was added as critic to challenge overreach. Human involvement was limited to observation and documentation.

## The Triangulation Protocol

![The wave at the 1/4 boundary](../visualizations/heatmap_wave.png)

*The 1/4 boundary seen from the observer's perspective. You stand in the cyan -- classical, convergent, real. The red wave approaches from above -- quantum, oscillatory, possible. Where they meet is where possibility becomes reality.*

These experiments converge on three measurable quantities:

```
1/4      (WHERE)       -- The destination: the bifurcation boundary
theta    (HOW FAR)     -- Compass heading: angular distance from ¼
tau_max  (HOW LONG)    -- Estimated time of arrival at the boundary
```

θ is not a frequency predictor. It is a **compass**. Measured values from the boundary crossing experiment (Bell+, Heisenberg, concurrence bridge, γ=0.05):

| θ (degrees) | C·Ψ | Meaning |
|-------------|------|----------|
| 60° | 1.00 | Deep quantum -- far from any classical attractor |
| 25° | 0.31 | Approaching -- complex fixed points narrowing |
| 9° | 0.26 | Almost there -- fixed points about to merge |
| **0°** | **0.25** | **At the boundary -- bifurcation point** |
| (real) | <0.25 | Classical -- two real fixed points, definite outcome |

One coordinate tells you something exists. Two narrow it down. Three locate it precisely. This is not metaphor -- it is the experimental program.

## What is proven, what is not

**Algebraically proven:**
- The 1/4 bound from fixed-point discriminant
- The equivalence between R = C(Psi + R)^2 and z -> z^2 + c bifurcation structure
- Complex fixed points above 1/4 with frequency theta

**Computationally verified:**
- 33:1 coherence ratio for symmetric vs. asymmetric coupling
- tau_max ~ N linear scaling
- delta = 0.42 for symmetric configurations

**Empirically observed (2026-02-08):**
- θ decreases continuously from 60° to 0° as decoherence pulls C·Ψ toward ¼
- At θ = 0° (C·Ψ = ¼ exactly), complex fixed points merge into one real point
- Below 1/4: two real fixed points emerge -- a stable attractor and an unstable one
- The Lindblad dynamics are smooth through the crossing -- no discontinuity in any measured quantity
- The topology of the solution space changes: 0 real attractors -> 2 real attractors

**Computationally verified (2026-02-08):**
- gamma * t_cross = 0.039 constant across gamma = 0.01 to 0.5 (gravitational invariance)
- theta trajectory collapses onto universal curve when normalized as tau = gamma * t
- Maximum deviation between gravitational environments: 0.0044 in C*Psi
- Quantum states survive ~48x longer in deep space (gamma=0.01) than near black hole (gamma=0.5)

**Proposed, not yet tested:**
- Physical interpretation of 1/4 as observer bandwidth limit
- θ trajectory patterns for different initial states / Hamiltonians
- Whether θ at crossing determines which fixed point is selected (Born rule connection)
- Mandelbrot bulb boundaries as different types of quantum transitions

We distinguish clearly between what the math says and what we think it means. The algebra is not negotiable. The interpretation is open for challenge.

    """Closed-form ‖M‖² from terms via F85 Π²-class Frobenius identity.

    Theorem F85 (proved in PROOF_F85_KBODY_GENERALIZATION) generalizes
    the F49 formula to k-body terms via Π²-class:

        ‖M(L_Z)‖²    = Σ_k 4·c(k)·‖H_k‖²_F·2^N
        ‖M(L_Z+T1)‖² = ‖M(L_Z)‖² + 4^(N−1) · [3·Σ γT1² + 4·(Σ γT1)²]

    where c(k) is the F85 Π²-class factor:

        c(truly term)              = 0     (M = 0 by Master Lemma)
        c(Π²-odd non-truly)        = 1     (factor 4·2^N)
        c(Π²-even non-truly)       = 2     (factor 8·2^N)

    Truly criterion (k-body): #Y even AND #Z even. At 2-body this
    reduces to "a == b OR {a,b} ⊆ {I,X}" (matches `_pauli_pair_is_truly`).

    Each non-truly term contributes independently because distinct
    Pauli strings within a Π²-class are orthogonal in Frobenius, AND
    Π²-classes are mutually orthogonal in operator space.

    For 2-body, F85's c(k) coincides with F49's n_YZ_k (Π²-odd ↔
    n_YZ=1, Π²-even non-truly ↔ n_YZ=2). For k ≥ 3, n_YZ is no
    longer the determining quantity (e.g., YYY has n_YZ=3 but c=1).

    T1 contribution is Hamiltonian-independent, γ_Z-independent, and
    orthogonal to the Hamiltonian palindrome residual (no cross-term).
    Verified at N=3..6 for arbitrary {γ_T1_l} distributions.

    Topology: 2-body uses the chain's bond graph (chain/ring/star/K_N
    all supported via F49); k ≥ 3 uses chain sliding-window semantics
    (F85 chain-only). Mixed-body term lists may degrade non-chain
    topology silently for the k-body group.

    Args:
        terms: list of Pauli-letter tuples. Each tuple has length k ≥ 1.
            Mixed body counts in the same call are supported.
        gamma_t1: optional T1 amplitude-damping rates. Scalar (uniform
                  across sites), list of length N, or None / 0 (no T1).

    #      (M = 0 by Master Lemma; truly = #Y even AND #Z even).
    #   2. Group remaining terms by Π²-class (pi2_odd or pi2_even_nontruly).

    #      F49 formula breaks; only Π²-class determines the factor c ∈ {1, 2}.

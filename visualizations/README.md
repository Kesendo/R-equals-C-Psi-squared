## The Wave

![The wave at the 1/4 boundary](heatmap_wave.png)

This is the parameter space of the iteration R_{n+1} = C(Psi + R_n)^2.

**Cyan** -- the classical regime. C*Psi < 1/4. The iteration converges. Fixed points are real. States are stable, definite, experienceable. This is where observers live.

**Red** -- the quantum regime. C*Psi > 1/4. The iteration oscillates forever. Fixed points are complex-valued -- paired conjugates that never settle. States are superposed, oscillating, not directly experienceable.

**The white curve** -- the phase boundary at C*Psi = 1/4. This is the same boundary that defines the main cardioid of the Mandelbrot set. It is the wavefront where possibility becomes reality.
